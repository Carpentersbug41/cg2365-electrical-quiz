# C&G 2365 Level 2 — Mini-Lessons Document (Course-Wide)
## What mini-lessons are, what they’re for, and why you need them (Units 201 / 202 / 203 / 204 / 210)

---

## 1) What “mini-lessons” are (in plain English)

A **mini-lesson** is a short, single-skill teaching block that:

- is **required** to do the course properly,
- shows up **across multiple units**,
- but **doesn’t get its own obvious headline lesson** in the syllabus.

The syllabus is organised by broad topics (e.g., “AC principles”, “earthing and bonding”, “installation practice”).  
Real learning happens through smaller skills like:

- converting **mA ↔ A** without errors  
- rearranging **V = IR** instantly  
- reading a test result and knowing **what it means**  
- understanding what changes in **series vs parallel**  
- knowing why a cable overheats (not just “because current”)  
- matching a real appliance scenario (cooker/shower/heater) to **accessories + protection + environment + testing**

Mini-lessons are the “missing rungs” on the ladder.

---

## 2) What mini-lessons are FOR (the job they do)

Mini-lessons do four practical jobs across the course:

### A) They fix prerequisites the course assumes you already have
A lot of Level 2 assumes you’re comfortable with units, maths, basic physics logic, tool use, and safety routines.
Most learners aren’t. Mini-lessons close that gap.

### B) They remove the “silent fail points”
People fail questions because of:
- prefixes/powers of ten
- formula rearrangement
- wrong “series/parallel rule”
- misunderstanding what a test reading means
- mixing up protection devices (MCB/RCD/RCBO)

Mini-lessons target those specific failure modes.

### C) They connect theory to real installs
The course can feel like “school science + random practical tasks”.
Mini-lessons are the bridges that make it feel like **electrician thinking**.

### D) They make revision and troubleshooting simple
Small blocks are easy to:
- quiz
- diagnose (“you’re weak on transposition”, not “you’re bad at science”)
- retest until mastery

---

## 3) Where mini-lessons sit in the course (how they connect Units 201–204)

**Think in 3 layers:**

### Layer 1 — Foundation Skills (used everywhere)
- units/prefixes, rearranging formulas, interpreting readings, basic diagrams

### Layer 2 — Bridge Skills (connect science → install decisions)
- heating effect, voltage drop meaning, fault logic, how protection devices *actually* protect

### Layer 3 — Scenario Bundles (“hidden topics”)
- cookers, showers, water heaters, heating circuits, bathrooms, transformers, relays
These are *real-world topics* that pull from multiple units at once.

---

## 4) The mini-lesson catalogue (course-wide)

### GROUP A — Maths, Units & “Numbers That Don’t Lie”
**Why needed:** stops 202 calculations and 204 test values from being guesswork.

**Mini-lessons**
1. **Engineering notation + prefixes** (m, µ, k, M; powers of ten)
2. **Unit conversion for electricians** (A/mA, Ω/kΩ, W/kW, J/kWh, mm²↔m²)
3. **Formula rearrangement drill** (make any variable the subject quickly)
4. **Proportional thinking** (“double R → what happens to I?”)
5. **Sanity checks** (does your answer make physical sense?)

**Used in**
- 202 (all calculations), 203 (ratings/specs), 204 (testing readings)

---

### GROUP B — Instruments, Readings & “What Does That Number Mean?”
**Why needed:** 204 testing becomes easy when you understand what each reading is telling you.

**Mini-lessons**
1. **What each meter function measures** (V, A, Ω, continuity, IR)
2. **Continuity meaning** (what continuity proves and what it doesn’t)
3. **Insulation resistance meaning** (what IR proves and why we disconnect loads)
4. **Polarity meaning** (what “correct polarity” actually prevents)
5. **Recording results** (what values belong on which lines of a test sheet)

**Used in**
- 202 (conceptual measurement awareness), 204 (inspection/testing), supports 201 safety language

---

### GROUP C — Core Circuit Behaviour (the rules that make everything predictable)
**Why needed:** stops circuits feeling like memorised rules; helps fault logic and exam answers.

**Mini-lessons**
1. **Series rules** (same current; voltage splits; R adds)
2. **Parallel rules** (same voltage; current splits; total R decreases)
3. **Series fault logic** (open/high resistance: what changes and why)
4. **Parallel fault logic** (one branch fails: what changes and why)
5. **Power pack** (P=VI, energy in kWh, heating effect of current)

**Used in**
- 202 directly, supports 203 appliance reasoning, supports 204 fault-finding logic

---

### GROUP D — Safety Science Bridges (why safety rules exist)
**Why needed:** this is where “science” becomes “site safety”.

**Mini-lessons**
1. **Heating effect of current → overheating risk**
2. **Shock severity factors** (current path, duration, resistance, voltage)
3. **Voltage drop concept** (what it is; symptoms; why long runs matter)
4. **Earth fault vs short vs overload** (what each is in plain terms)

**Used in**
- 201 (safety reasoning), 202 (science), 203 (protection/environment decisions), 204 (diagnosis)

---

### GROUP E — Magnetism & AC Bridges (the “hidden 202 topics” that show up everywhere)
**Why needed:** explains transformers/relays/motors without needing Level 3 depth.

**Mini-lessons**
1. **Magnetic field around conductor + solenoid**
2. **Electromagnets as devices** (relay/contactor/solenoid behaviour)
3. **AC waveform vocabulary** (frequency, period, RMS, peak)
4. **Transformer principle (Level 2)** (mutual induction; step-up/down concept; why AC matters)

**Used in**
- 202 (magnetism/AC), supports 203 understanding of control gear, supports 204 awareness of controls on real installs

---

### GROUP F — Installation Decisions (why we choose certain kit and methods)
**Why needed:** this is where 203 becomes coherent instead of random product knowledge.

**Mini-lessons**
1. **Cable selection logic** (current, environment, mechanical protection)
2. **Containment selection logic** (what protects what; why neat routing matters)
3. **Accessory selection logic** (isolators/FCUs/switches; what each is for)
4. **Protection device roles** (MCB vs RCD vs RCBO; what each protects against)
5. **External influences basics** (bathroom zones, IP ratings, heat, moisture)

**Used in**
- 203 heavily, supported by 202, applied in 204

---

### GROUP G — Work Method & Professional Routine (the “how not to be a liability” blocks)
**Why needed:** because 201/210 are the glue and affect practical assessment.

**Mini-lessons**
1. **Hazard vs risk** (and how control measures reduce risk)
2. **Hierarchy of control** (eliminate → substitute → engineering → admin → PPE)
3. **Safe isolation routine** (the steps, the logic, and the “prove dead” mindset)
4. **Good workmanship standards** (tidy routing, correct stripping, secure terminations)
5. **Communication on site** (reporting defects, asking for clarification, handover notes)

**Used in**
- 201 and 210 directly, applied in 204 constantly

---

## 5) “Hidden Topic” lessons (scenario bundles) — what you were pointing at

These are the real-world topics that *should* be their own lessons, because they combine multiple units.

Each hidden topic lesson is built like this:
- **Science hook (202):** what’s happening electrically
- **Tech choices (203):** accessories + protection + environment
- **Practice (204):** how it’s wired/terminated + what tests matter
- **Safety/communication (201/210):** isolation and basic professional behaviour

Examples:
- **Cooker circuits** (load/current, isolator/accessory, protection, diversity awareness, termination/testing)
- **Water heaters/immersion** (isolation, wet environment, bonding context, protection, testing)
- **Space heating** (continuous load concept, protection, cable considerations, environment)
- **Bathrooms & zones** (external influences + device selection + RCD logic)
- **Transformers & control circuits** (induction basics + why devices use step-down control)
- **Relays/contactors** (electromagnet lesson → applied device lesson)

These scenario lessons don’t replace the unit structure — they make it usable and memorable.

---

## 6) How to use this in your course build (simple rules)

### Rule 1: Teach the official units in order…
…but insert mini-lessons when you hit a predictable sticking point.

### Rule 2: Treat mini-lessons like “skills with mastery”
Each mini-lesson should end with:
- 3 quick checks (easy)
- 1 scenario question (exam style)
- retest immediately if wrong

### Rule 3: After core coverage, add scenario bundles as “specialisation lessons”
That’s where cookers/water heaters/transformers become their own lessons inside 202/203/204.

---

## 7) What we do next (your project flow)

1) **Finish the “hidden topics map” for Unit 202** (you’ve started this)
2) Build the same map for **Unit 203**
3) Build the same map for **Unit 204**
4) Convert each hidden topic into a clean “mini-lesson spec”:
   - title
   - what it teaches
   - which unit sections it draws from
   - common mistakes
   - a 10-question check

If you say “go”, I’ll do the next deliverable as:
**Unit 202 hidden topics → turned into a numbered set of extra lesson specs** (ready to teach or plug into a prompt system).
