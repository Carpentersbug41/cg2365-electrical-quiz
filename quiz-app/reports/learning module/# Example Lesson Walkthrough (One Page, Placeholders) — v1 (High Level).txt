# Example Lesson Walkthrough (One Page, Placeholders) — v1 (High Level)
**Project:** C&G 2365 Level 2 — Unit 202 Electrical Science  
**Audience:** Planner / Developer / Stakeholders  
**Status:** Draft v1 (high-level)  
**Last updated:** 2026-01-13


---


## 1) Purpose
This walkthrough demonstrates the *intended learner experience* on a single lesson page using placeholders.
It shows how lesson content + tutor behaviours + practice + checking fit together without going into implementation detail.


---


## 2) Example lesson
**Lesson:** 202.4A — Series circuits: rules (I, V, R) + why they’re true  
**Intended layout:** Split-Vis (diagram persistent)  
**Diagram:** Placeholder (to be replaced later)


---


## 3) What the learner sees (page flow)
### A) Quick start (top of page)
- **Title**
- **Learning outcomes (2–4 bullets)**
- **Key vocabulary** (short list)
- **Diagram placeholder** (visible and labelled)


### B) Core teaching (short)
- A brief explanation of the three series rules (I, V, R)
- A short “why” explanation tied to the diagram (single loop, no branches)


### C) Worked model (I Do)
- One fully worked example:
  - Given a simple series circuit with two resistors and supply voltage
  - Show how to find total resistance (and optionally current)


### D) Guided practice (We Do)
- A similar problem where:
  - the learner provides Step 1 (e.g., identify the rule or compute R_total)
  - the system confirms/corrects and prompts Step 2


### E) Independent practice (You Do)
- 3–5 questions:
  - one discrimination item (“Is this series or parallel?”)
  - one calculation item
  - one short explanation (“Why is current the same in series?”)


### F) Answers (behind reveal)
- Answer key hidden by default
- Learner can reveal after attempting


### G) Spaced review (end of page)
- 2–3 short questions from prerequisite topics (e.g., Ohm’s Law rearranging)


---


## 4) What the tutor does during the lesson (high level)
### Teach (Coach)
- Prompts the learner with **one question at a time**
- If stuck: provides a scaffold (binary choice / fill-the-blank / step prompt)
- Encourages an attempt before giving a full solution


### Fix (Remediate)
- If the learner applies the wrong rule (e.g., uses parallel thinking):
  - gives a short correction
  - retests immediately with a near-identical variant


### Check (Assessor) — not used on this page by default
- The page may link to a separate Focus Mode quiz for formal checking


---


## 5) What “success” looks like on this page
By the end, the learner can:
- state the three series rules correctly
- explain “why” (single path/no branches) in simple terms
- correctly identify series circuits
- complete basic series calculations reliably
- answer at least one spaced review item correctly


---


## 6) Why this matters (high level)
This single page demonstrates the repeatable pattern:
**structured lesson → guided practice → independent practice → delayed checking via quizzes + review.**
If this works well, scaling to more pages is repetition, not reinvention.
