# Goals, Scope, and MVP Slice — v1 (High Level)
**Project:** C&G 2365 Level 2 — Unit 202 Electrical Science  
**Audience:** Planner / Developer / Stakeholders  
**Status:** Draft v1  
**Last updated:** 2026-01-13


---


## 1) Goals (what success means)
### Primary goals
- **Deep understanding** of Unit 202 concepts (not just formula memorisation).
- **Exam readiness** through consistent, mark-scheme-aligned checking.
- **Reliable teaching quality** independent of instructor variation.
- **Scalable content production** (repeatable lessons without quality drift).


### Secondary goals
- Reduce learner frustration and dropout by providing clear steps and corrective feedback.
- Enable independent study (the system acts as the “teacher in the room”).


---


## 2) Non-goals (what we are not trying to do)
- Not a general-purpose electrical assistant or regs interpreter.
- Not a full Learning Management System (no complex admin, cohorts, etc. in MVP).
- Not video-first teaching.
- Not covering all 2365 units or levels at once.


---


## 3) Scope (what’s included)
### Included (MVP scope)
- Unit 202 lesson pages for a **single pilot topic cluster**.
- Embedded tutor behaviours: **Teach (Coach)**, **Check (Assessor)**, **Fix (Remediate)**.
- Practice questions and quizzes tied directly to lesson outcomes.
- Basic progress tracking at the level of:
  - completion,
  - quiz attempts,
  - pass/fail thresholds,
  - review reminders.


### Included (post-MVP, still Unit 202)
- Expand from pilot cluster to the full Unit 202 syllabus lesson-by-lesson.
- Improve question variety and coverage.
- Add richer review scheduling and more robust mastery evidence.

## 4) MVP Slice (the smallest thing that proves the concept)
### Why a slice
We want to validate:
- learners actually learn,
- the tutor behaves correctly (coach vs assessor),
- content scales via templates,
- checking and remediation feel “assessor-grade”.


### The slice (pilot module)
- **Series and parallel circuits**:
  - rules + “why”
  - basic calculations
  - discrimination (choosing the correct rule)
  - targeted remediation for common misunderstandings
- A small but meaningful question bank for this slice (enough to test loop quality).
- A simple mastery gate (pass + delayed re-check) to confirm learning sticks.


---


## 5) Success criteria for the MVP slice (high level)
- Learners can correctly:
  - identify series vs parallel situations,
  - apply the correct rules,
  - complete standard calculations with acceptable accuracy.
- The system produces:
  - clear feedback,
  - consistent marking,
  - repeatable improvement across attempts.
- The content + tutor pattern feels repeatable for scaling to the rest of Unit 202.


---


## 6) Boundaries and constraints (high level)
- Keep build lightweight: prioritize the learning loop over polish.
- Keep prompts and tutoring grounded in course content for MVP.
- Avoid complex feature work until the slice proves learning value.
