# Concept Overview (One-Pager) — v1
**Project:** C&G 2365 Level 2 — Unit 202 Electrical Science (MVP: Series/Parallel)  
**Audience:** Planner / Developer / Stakeholders  
**Status:** Draft v1  
**Last updated:** 2026-01-13


---


## 1) What we’re building
A web-based learning system for **City & Guilds 2365 Level 2 (Unit 202)** that teaches electrical science with:
- clear, structured lesson pages (the “truth”)
- an embedded AI tutor that behaves like a **teacher + assessor**
- practice and testing that produces **measurable mastery**, not vague “understanding”


This is not “ChatGPT in a box”. It’s a course system where learning is driven by **practice, feedback, and re-testing**.


---


## 2) Why we’re building it
Many learners struggle because:
- teaching quality varies (subject experts aren’t always strong teachers)
- learners memorise formulas without understanding how to choose and apply them
- existing “AI tutor” products often explain well but don’t assess or enforce learning standards


Our goal is **deep understanding + exam readiness** using a system that reliably teaches and checks knowledge.


---


## 3) Who it’s for
- Learners studying **2365 Level 2**, especially those stuck on Unit 202.
- Learners who want step-by-step learning and clear feedback.
- Tutors/centres that want consistent teaching quality.


---


## 4) The core approach (how it works at a high level)
### 4.1 Lesson pages are the single source of truth
- Each lesson is a structured page with: outcomes, explanations, examples, practice, and review.
- The AI tutor is constrained to teach from the lesson content + approved question bank.


### 4.2 The tutor runs a learning loop (not a chat)
The tutor operates in three behaviours:
- **Teach (Coach):** explains in small steps and asks questions for the learner to answer.
- **Check (Assessor):** runs quizzes/tests with strict marking.
- **Fix (Remediate):** targets specific misunderstandings and immediately retests.


### 4.3 Learning is measured and enforced
- Learners don’t “move on” just because they read the page.
- Progress is based on **retrieval practice** and passing checks, followed by **delayed re-checks** to confirm learning sticks.


---


## 5) What makes it different
- **Syllabus-tight:** teaches exactly what Unit 202 requires.
- **Assessor-grade:** uses mark-scheme-style checking rather than vibes.
- **Scalable:** consistent lesson structure means we can produce many lessons without quality collapse.
- **Grounded:** tutor must reference course content (and refuses unsupported tangents in MVP).


---


## 6) MVP scope (first slice)
We build one end-to-end learning slice to prove the system:
- Series vs parallel rules + calculations + discrimination practice
- A small tagged question set (enough to validate tutoring + marking + mastery)
- Tutor behaviours (Teach/Check/Fix)
- Basic progress tracking and review prompts


If the slice works, the rest of Unit 202 becomes repeatable content production.


---


## 7) What we are not doing (for MVP)
- Not building a full LMS
- Not covering all units immediately
- Not adding advanced features (analytics, community, video) until the core learning loop works


---


## 8) Next planning docs
- Layout Template System (three layouts)
- Learning Method Rules (non-negotiables)
- Example Lesson Walkthrough (with placeholders)
- Tutor Overview (high-level contract)
- QA/Evaluation Overview (Golden Set + invariants)
