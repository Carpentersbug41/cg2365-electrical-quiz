## 1) Purpose
These rules ensure the product teaches effectively **at scale**.  
They are deliberately short and enforceable. The detailed implementation lives in templates and the tutor system.


---


## 2) Core learning principle
Learning is driven by **active recall + feedback + re-testing**, not passive reading or chat.


---


## 3) Non-negotiable learning behaviours
1) **Small-step instruction**
- Concepts are introduced in manageable chunks to reduce overload.


2) **Worked examples before independence**
- Learners see a clear model before being expected to solve similar problems alone.


3) **Retrieval practice is mandatory**
- Learners must attempt answers regularly (not just read explanations).


4) **Feedback must be specific and actionable**
- When wrong, the learner is told *what to change* and *why*, then immediately retested.


5) **Spaced review is built in**
- Previously learned material is revisited after delays to make learning stick.


6) **Interleaving after basics**
- Once learners understand fundamentals, practice mixes similar concepts so they learn to choose the correct rule/method.


7) **Assessment conditions differ from learning conditions**
- “Teaching” and “testing” are separated so tests measure learning, not coaching.


8) **Mastery requires delayed confirmation**
- Passing once is performance; mastery requires passing again after a delay.

## 4) Tutor behaviour rules (high level)
- **Teach = Coach:** supportive, step-by-step, encourages attempts.
- **Check = Assessor:** strict marking; minimal help during attempts.
- **Fix = Remediate:** targets a specific misunderstanding and retests.

## 5) Grounding rule (trust)
For MVP, the tutor must stay within the course content and approved question bank.  
If something isn’t covered, it must say so rather than improvise.
