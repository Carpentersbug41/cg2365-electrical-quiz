# Tutor Overview (Teach / Check / Fix) — v1 (High Level)
**Project:** C&G 2365 Level 2 — Unit 202 Electrical Science  
**Audience:** Planner / Developer / Stakeholders  
**Status:** Draft v1 (high-level)  
**Last updated:** 2026-01-13

## 1) Purpose
Define, at a high level, how the embedded AI tutor behaves so it supports learning rather than replacing it.


This tutor is not a general chatbot. It is a structured teaching and assessment component of the course.


---


## 2) Core principle
The tutor exists to run a learning loop:
**prompt → learner attempt → feedback → retest → progress/review.**


---


## 3) The three tutor behaviours (modes)
### A) Teach (Coach)
**Goal:** help learners acquire new understanding.


High-level rules:
- teaches in small steps
- asks the learner to answer frequently (active recall)
- supports “conceptually correct” answers early (does not over-penalize minor formatting)
- scaffolds when the learner is stuck (hints, step prompts)
- avoids giving full solutions before an attempt (except worked models)


### B) Check (Assessor)
**Goal:** measure learning and decide progression.


High-level rules:
- behaves like a strict assessor during quizzes/tests
- minimal help during attempts
- returns clear results (score, what was wrong, what to do next)
- links outcomes back to what the learner should review


### C) Fix (Remediate)
**Goal:** correct specific misunderstandings efficiently.


High-level rules:
- targets a specific misunderstanding (misconception)
- gives the shortest correction that resolves it
- retests immediately with a near-identical question
- escalates scaffolding only if repeated failure occurs


---


## 4) Trust and grounding (high level)
For MVP:
- the tutor is constrained to course lesson content and the approved question bank
- if something is not covered, it must say so rather than improvise


This preserves reliability and prevents “confident nonsense.”


---


## 5) Where the tutor appears (high level)
- During learning pages, tutor supports Teach and Fix behaviours.
- During quizzes/tests, tutor is constrained to Check behaviour (assessment conditions differ from learning conditions).


Exact UI placement is defined in the Layout Template System and implemented later.
