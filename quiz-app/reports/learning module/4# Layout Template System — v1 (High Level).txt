# Layout Template System — v1 (High Level)
**Project:** C&G 2365 Level 2 — Unit 202 Electrical Science  
**Audience:** Planner / Developer / Stakeholders  
**Status:** Draft v1 (high-level)  
**Last updated:** 2026-01-13

## 1) Purpose
We use a small number of reusable layout templates so the product stays:
- **scalable** (no bespoke page design),
- **consistent** (learners don’t re-learn the UI every page),
- and **fit for purpose** (different cognitive tasks need different presentation).


This prevents “template drift” and keeps authoring repeatable.

## 2) Core principle
We standardize **layouts**, not individual pages.  
Pages select one layout and then follow the course’s lesson structure and tutor rules.

## 3) The “Holy Trinity” of layouts (MVP)
### Layout A — Split-Vis (Diagram Persistent)
**Use for:** spatial/topology learning (e.g., series/parallel/mixed circuits, current paths, voltage across branches, meter connection visuals).  
**Requirement:** the learner can read/answer while the diagram remains visible.


### Layout B — Linear Flow (Reading + Practice)
**Use for:** definitions, formulas, non-spatial explanations, standard practice, and reference-style content.  
**Requirement:** a clean reading experience with low distraction and easy practice entry.


### Layout C — Focus Mode (Assessment)
**Use for:** quizzes, timed drills, mastery checks.  
**Requirement:** minimal UI and reduced help so assessment measures learning rather than coaching.

## 4) Why we need multiple layouts (high level)
- Some topics are **diagram-dependent**; learners must not lose the visual context while reading or answering.
- Some topics are best taught in a **normal reading flow** with worked examples and practice.
- Assessment must feel **different from learning** to preserve test validity and learner expectations.


---


## 5) Tutor behaviour alignment (high level)
- Layout A and B support **Teach (Coach)** and **Fix** behaviours.
- Layout C enforces **Check (Assessor)** behaviour (limited help until submission).

## 6) MVP boundary
This doc intentionally does not define pixel layouts, components, or rendering technology.  
Those details belong in the implementation spec once the concept and three layouts are agreed.
