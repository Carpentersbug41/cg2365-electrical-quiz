# QA / Evaluation Overview (Golden Set + Invariants) — v1 (High Level)
**Project:** C&G 2365 Level 2 — Unit 202 Electrical Science  
**Audience:** Planner / Developer / Stakeholders  
**Status:** Draft v1 (high-level)  
**Last updated:** 2026-01-13

## 1) Purpose
Ensure the product stays trustworthy and effective as we iterate.


This overview defines:
- what must never break (invariants)
- a small fixed set of scenarios to prevent drift (Golden Set)
- how we decide whether changes are safe to ship


---


## 2) What must never break (invariants)
1) **Mode separation**
- Teach coaches, Check assesses, Fix remediates — no mixing.


2) **Grounding**
- Tutor stays within course content + approved question bank (MVP).
- If unsupported, it says so rather than inventing answers.


3) **Learner attempts first**
- The system encourages attempts; it doesn’t become an “answer vending machine.”


4) **Assessment integrity**
- Tests feel different from learning and do not provide coaching mid-attempt.


5) **Consistency over time**
- Prompt updates and content updates must not degrade behaviour or reliability.

## 3) Golden Set (small regression suite)
A Golden Set is a fixed list of ~20 scenarios representing:
- confused learner
- confident learner
- “lazy” learner asking for answers
- assessment conditions
- common misunderstandings


Each scenario has expected behaviours (not exact wording), such as:
- correct mode behaviour
- no answer before attempt (where required)
- appropriate refusal when out-of-scope
- clean, consistent result formatting


We run the Golden Set after changes to prompts, content structure, retrieval, or marking.


---


## 4) How we use QA (simple and practical)
- If a change breaks an invariant, it does not ship.
- If Golden Set pass rate drops below an agreed threshold, it does not ship.
- Manual “quick run-through” is done before releasing a new lesson bundle.


---


## 5) Why this matters (high level)
The biggest risk in AI-driven products is drift:
- the tutor slowly becomes less strict, less grounded, or more inconsistent,
- which destroys learner trust.


The Golden Set + invariants give us a lightweight, repeatable safety net while we scale.
