You are exploring this in the context of basic electrical science, which forms the foundation for understanding how motors and transformers work in an installation. \n\n*   Magnets always possess two distinct regions of force.\n*   Like poles push away from each other.\n*   Unlike poles pull toward each other.\n\n**What this is**\nMagnetism is a physical phenomenon produced by the motion of electric charge, resulting in attractive and repulsive forces between objects. Every magnet has two specific ends known as **Magnetic Poles**. These are designated as the North pole and the South pole. Even if you were to cut a magnet in half, each piece would still develop its own North and South poles. The area surrounding these poles where the magnetic force can be detected is known as the magnetic field. \n\n**Why it matters**\nUnderstanding how **Magnetic Poles** interact is critical for an electrician because it explains the mechanical rotation in electric motors. By using the laws of attraction and repulsion, we can force a motor's internal components to move. Furthermore, this knowledge is essential when identifying how protective devices like circuit breakers use magnetic trip elements to disconnect a circuit during a fault. \n\n**Key facts / rules**\n*   Every magnet must have a North pole and a South pole.\n*   The law of attraction states that unlike poles (North and South) will pull toward each other.\n*   The law of repulsion states that like poles (North and North, or South and South) will push away from each other.\n*   Magnetic field lines are typically illustrated as exiting the North pole and entering the South pole.\n*   The magnetic force is strongest at the poles and weakens as you move further away.\n*   Magnetic materials, such as iron or steel, are attracted to either pole of a magnet.\n\n**How to recognise it**\nTo recognise the interaction between magnets, you look for the direction of the physical force being applied. If you bring two magnets together and feel a resisting force that prevents them from touching, you are observing repulsion between like poles. Conversely, if the magnets snap together with force, you are observing attraction between unlike poles. On the diagram, notice that the **north-pole** and **south-pole** labels indicate the specific regions where the magnetic force is most concentrated. You can also recognise these interactions through the behavior of a compass needle, which is itself a small magnet that aligns its poles with the Earth's magnetic field.\n\n**Common mistakes**\nLearners often confuse **attraction** with **repulsion**; **attraction** is the pulling together of unlike poles whereas **repulsion** is the pushing apart of like poles. Another common error is assuming that a magnet only has one pole or that the poles can be separated, which is physically impossible in standard electrical applications.\n\n**Key Points**\n*   Magnets always have two poles: North and South.\n*   Like poles repel; unlike poles attract.\n*   The magnetic field is the region where these forces act.\n*   Force is most concentrated at the poles themselves.\n\n**Quick recap**\nMagnets interact based on their poles. Like poles always push apart (repulsion), while opposite poles always pull together (attraction). These forces are the strongest at the ends of the magnet, which we call the North and South poles.\n\n### Coming Up Next\nNow that you understand how poles interact, we will look at how we measure the \"amount\" and \"concentration\" of the magnetic field using flux and flux density.",

This is essential for understanding how magnetic components like transformer cores are selected for specific electrical loads.\n\n*   Flux represents the total quantity of magnetic field lines.\n*   Flux density represents the concentration of those lines per unit area.\n*   Different units (Webers and Teslas) are used to measure these distinct properties.\n\n**What this is**\n**Magnetic Flux** refers to the total number of magnetic field lines passing through a specific surface. Think of it as the \"total volume\" of magnetism. The SI unit for this is the **Weber (Wb)**. On the other hand, **Magnetic Flux Density** describes how tightly packed those field lines are within a specific area. It is a measure of the strength of the magnetic field at a particular point. The SI unit for flux density is the **Tesla (T)**, which is defined as one **Weber (Wb)** per square metre.\n\n**Why it matters**\nIn electrical engineering, we need to know more than just the total amount of magnetism; we need to know if that magnetism is \"strong\" enough to do work. For example, in a transformer, if the **Magnetic Flux Density** becomes too high, the iron core can become saturated and stop working efficiently. Choosing the right material and cross-sectional area ensures that the flux is handled correctly without overheating the component.\n\n**Key facts / rules**\n*   **Magnetic Flux** is the total amount of magnetic field, measured in **Webers (Wb)**.\n*   **Magnetic Flux Density** is the concentration of the field, measured in **Tesla (T)**.\n*   One **Tesla (T)** is equal to one Weber per square metre (Wb/m²).\n*   If the area decreases but the total flux stays the same, the flux density increases.\n*   If the total flux increases but the area stays the same, the flux density increases.\n*   Flux density is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction.\n\n**How to recognise it**\nTo classify scenarios correctly, look for whether the description focuses on a \"total\" or a \"concentration.\" For example, if a manufacturer states the total output of a magnet, they are describing **Magnetic Flux**. If they describe the strength of the field at the surface of a specific 10mm² sensor, they are describing **Magnetic Flux Density**. A helpful conceptual analogy is rain: the total amount of water falling on a whole garden is the flux, while the amount of water hitting a single square inch of a patio is the flux density. On the diagram, notice that the **magnetic-flux-density** is represented by how closely the lines are drawn together in a specific area.\n\n**Common mistakes**\nLearners often confuse **Magnetic Flux** with **Magnetic Flux Density**; **Magnetic Flux** is the total amount of field lines (measured in Webers) whereas **Magnetic Flux Density** is how concentrated those lines are in a specific area (measured in Tesla). Many people forget that density is dependent on the area the flux is passing through.\n\n**Key Points**\n*   Flux (Wb) = Total amount of magnetic field.\n*   Flux Density (T) = Concentration of field per square metre.\n*   Smaller area with the same flux results in higher density.\n*   Tesla is the unit of measurement for field strength (density).\n\n**Quick recap**\n**Magnetic Flux** (Webers) tells us the total amount of magnetic field lines present. **Magnetic Flux Density** (Tesla) tells us how squashed together those lines are. If you squeeze the same amount of flux into a smaller pipe, the density goes up.\n\n### Coming Up Next\nWith these basics mastered, we will move on to see how electricity can be used to create these magnetic fields in a process called electromagnetism.",
