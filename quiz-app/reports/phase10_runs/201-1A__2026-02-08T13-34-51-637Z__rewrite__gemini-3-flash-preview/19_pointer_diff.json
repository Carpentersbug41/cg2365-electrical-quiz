      "before": "### In this lesson\nIn this lesson, you will learn how legal responsibilities for safety are assigned to individuals and employers in the workplace. You are exploring these roles within the context of a typical electrical installation project where multiple people must cooperate to stay safe. \n\n*   The legal definitions of a dutyholder and duty of care.\n*   The high-level responsibilities of employers to provide a safe environment.\n*   The legal duties of employees to work safely and follow procedures.\n\n**What this is**\nIn the UK, workplace safety is governed by the **HASAWA** (Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974). This act establishes that every person in a workplace has a **Duty of Care**, which is a legal obligation to take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions that could foreseeably cause harm to others. Within this framework, a **Dutyholder** is an individual or organisation with specific legal responsibilities to manage risks. For example, a site manager is a dutyholder for the site's safety, while an apprentice has a duty of care to their workmates. These terms ensure that safety is not just a suggestion, but a requirement of the law.\n\n**Why it matters**\nUnderstanding these roles is vital because it ensures that everyone knows exactly what is expected of them. In the electrical industry, the risks are high; failing to meet your duty of care could lead to serious injury or prosecution. By identifying who is the relevant **Dutyholder** for a specific task, such as maintaining tools or providing safety briefings, the team can function without gaps in safety management. It also ensures that a **Competent Person** is always assigned to technical tasks, ensuring that those with the right training and experience are the ones making safety-critical decisions.\n\n**Key facts / rules**\n*   The **HASAWA** is the primary legislation that defines the duties of employers and employees.\n*   Employers must provide safe systems of work and a safe working environment.\n*   Employers are responsible for providing necessary training, information, and supervision.\n*   Employees must take reasonable care of their own health and safety and that of others.\n*   Employees are legally required to cooperate with their employer on safety matters.\n*   Employees must not intentionally or recklessly interfere with or misuse safety equipment.\n*   Specific workplace safety tasks, such as reporting a broken ladder, are the legal responsibility of the employee.\n*   Providing correct Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is a high-level responsibility of the employer.\n\n**How to recognise it**\nYou can recognise these roles by looking at the actions being performed on a job site. If you see someone creating a safety policy or paying for new safety boots, you are looking at an employer fulfilling their role. If you see an electrician wearing their hard hat and checking their voltage indicator before work, you are seeing an employee fulfilling their duty of care. A common confusion is thinking that only the \"boss\" is responsible for safety; however, you can recognise an employee's responsibility whenever a worker stops to report a hazard or follows a written method statement. Another distinguishing feature is the level of authority: an employer has the authority to change the system of work, whereas the employee has the responsibility to follow that system accurately.\n\n**Common mistakes**\nA frequent error is believing that an employee is not responsible if they were \"just following orders\" to work unsafely. Under the **HASAWA**, every employee has an individual duty of care and must refuse to work in a way they know is dangerous. Another mistake is assuming that a **Competent Person** knows everything; even the most experienced electrician must still follow the specific site rules set by the employer.\n\n**Key Points**\n*   **Duty of Care** applies to everyone on site, regardless of their rank.\n*   The **HASAWA** is the \"umbrella\" law for all UK workplace safety.\n*   Employers provide the \"hardware\" (tools, PPE, safe site) and the \"software\" (training, systems).\n*   Employees provide the \"compliance\" (using PPE, following rules, reporting issues).\n\n**Quick recap**\nHealth and safety is a shared responsibility defined by the **HASAWA**. Employers must provide the training and equipment needed to work safely, while employees must use those resources correctly and look out for their colleagues. Everyone is a dutyholder in some capacity, and everyone owes a duty of care to those around them.\n\n### Coming Up Next\nNow that we have covered individuals, we will look at how the wider organisation and the client contribute to a safe working environment.",

You will see how these roles provide the foundation for safe work on any electrical project.\n\n*   The role of the organisation in creating safety systems and policies.\n*   The responsibilities of the **Client** to provide site information and access.\n*   How these roles ensure compliance with environmental and health and safety legislation.\n\n**What this is**\nWhile individual employers and employees have duties, the \"Organisation\" refers to the company as a legal entity. The organisation is responsible for the high-level management systems, such as health and safety policies and risk management processes. The **Client** is the person or organisation for whom the project is being carried out. They are not necessarily the employer of the electricians, but they own or control the premises where the work happens. Both must work together to ensure that the work does not harm people or the environment.\n\n**Why it matters**\nThe organisation provides the framework that allows a **Competent Person** to work effectively. Without organisational policies, there would be no consistency in how risks are managed across different sites. The **Client** is equally important because they hold vital information that the workers might not know. For example, if a building contains asbestos or hidden live services, the **Client** is the one who must provide that information. Failing to identify these roles leads to \"information gaps\" where workers might accidentally drill into a hazardous material because they weren't told it was there.\n\n**Key facts / rules**\n*   Organisations must have a written health and safety policy if they employ five or more people.\n*   The organisation is responsible for ensuring staff are competent through inductions and training records.\n*   The organisation must maintain documentation, such as insurance and safety records.\n*   The **Client** must provide accurate site information, including the location of existing services.\n*   The **Client** must allow sufficient time and resources for the work to be completed safely.\n*   The **Client** is responsible for informing contractors about known hazards, such as asbestos.\n*   Environmental legislation requires the organisation to manage waste and prevent pollution on site.\n*   Both the organisation and the **Client** must cooperate to ensure safe access and egress for all workers.\n\n**How to recognise it**\nYou can recognise the organisation's role through the presence of \"systems.\" If you are asked to sign an induction form or read a company-wide safety manual, you are interacting with the organisation's duties. You can recognise the **Client** role when you receive a site plan or a report identifying where asbestos is located. A common point of confusion is who provides the site info; remember, the organisation provides the *procedure* for the work, but the **Client** provides the *information* about the building itself. You would see the organisation's influence in the maintenance records of the company van, whereas you see the **Client**'s influence in the designated parking areas or the specific hours you are allowed to work on their premises.\n\n**Common mistakes**\nWorkers often mistake the **Client** for their employer. While the **Client** pays for the work, your employer (the organisation) is usually who provides your PPE and tools. Another mistake is ignoring environmental duties, such as improper disposal of fluorescent tubes or batteries; the organisation must provide the system for this, but the individual must follow it to remain compliant with environmental laws.\n\n**Key Points**\n*   Organisations provide the policies, documentation, and management systems.\n*   The **Client** provides the site-specific facts, such as hazard locations and access rules.\n*   Environmental protection is a legal duty for the organisation, not just a suggestion.\n*   Safe working requires the **Client** to provide enough time for the job to be done right.\n\n**Quick recap**\nSafety is a team effort involving the organisation and the **Client**. The organisation sets the rules and manages the staff, while the **Client** ensures the site is ready and safe for work to begin. By sharing information and following established policies, both parties help prevent accidents and environmental damage.\n\n### Coming Up Next\nWith the roles and responsibilities clear, we will next look at the specific health and safety legislation that governs the electrical industry in more detail.",
