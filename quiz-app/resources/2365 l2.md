# 2. Centre requirements

## Approval

### Centres already offering City & Guilds qualifications
If already approved to offer the **2330 Certificate in Electrotechnical Technology**, centres can apply for 2365-02 via **fast track approval** (City & Guilds website).

Fast track may be used if:
- no changes to how the qualification is delivered, and
- all approval criteria are met (per fast track guidance notes)

Fast track approval is available for **12 months from launch**; after that, centres must use the standard Qualification Approval Process.

### Centres NOT already offering City & Guilds qualifications
New centres must gain:
- **centre approval**, and
- **qualification approval**

Refer to *Centre Manual — Supporting Customer Excellence*.

---

## Resource requirements

### Physical resources and site agreements
Centres may use designated areas to develop practical skills and assess simulated practical assignments. Equipment/systems must meet industrial standards and function under normal working conditions.

### Human resources (staff competence)
Staff must be able to demonstrate occupational expertise, including:
- technical competence in the delivery area(s)
- appropriate qualifications (as per handbook)
- recent relevant experience in the area assessed
- occupational competence in BSE areas being delivered/assessed (at or above the level delivered), including current legislation/regulations/codes of practice

**Important:** Staff may hold more than one role (e.g., tutor + assessor), but must **never** verify their own assessments.

#### Assessors (qualification expectations)
Assessors must either:
- hold or be working towards TAQA (A1/A2 – D32/33 updated) standards and maintain CPD evidence, **or**
- hold another suitable equivalent assessor qualification endorsed by the SSC and/or awarding organisation

#### Assessor occupational competence evidence (examples)
Verifiable evidence may include one or more of:
- sector qualification at/above the level delivered/assessed (or earlier forerunner quals + CPD showing knowledge of current standards)
- up-to-date CPD record, including registration with an appropriate industry body or relevant occupational qualifications
- verifiable CV of industry experience and current practice (at/above level assessed)
- thorough knowledge and understanding of qualification standards/requirements

#### Assessor CPD
Assessors’ competence must be updated regularly and periodically reconfirmed via CPD evidence, quality assured by City & Guilds.
Examples of CPD opportunities:
- conferences/events
- trade publications/journals
- SSC / professional / trade association events  
(At least annually, with evidence kept in a verifiable CPD record.)

---

## Internal Quality Assurers (IQA)
IQAs must have:
- occupational experience (BSE-related qualification or proven competence/experience)
- access to relevant occupational expertise
- be working towards or achieved a recognised IQA qualification (e.g., Level 4 Award in IQA of Assessment Processes and Practice)
- CPD evidence to current standards (especially if holding older D34/V1 quals)
- evidence of being up-to-date with BSE industry (trade publications, courses, networking, industry events, etc.)

---

## Guidance note
If questions arise about an individual’s occupational competence/qualification, refer to the centre’s Qualifications Adviser. They may escalate to Portfolio/Group Portfolio Consultant.

---

## Quality assurance (overview)
Centres must have effective QA systems.  
- Centres: internal quality assurance  
- City & Guilds: external quality assurance  
External QA reflects CASS minimum requirements (Ofqual General Conditions, section H2).

---

## Candidate entry requirements
No formal entry requirements set by City & Guilds, but centres must ensure candidates have the potential/opportunity to succeed.

### Age restriction
Approved for learners **16+**.

### Accreditation of prior learning (APL)
Guidance on APL between 2365 and 2357 was indicated as available via City & Guilds website.

# 3. Delivering the qualification

## Initial assessment and induction
Before starting, an initial assessment should identify:
- specific training needs
- required support/guidance
- previously completed units/credits relevant to the qualification
- appropriate qualification type and level

Centres should provide induction so candidates understand:
- qualification requirements
- candidate responsibilities
- centre responsibilities  
This can be recorded as a learning contract.

**Key requirement:** Induction must ensure candidates understand this qualification does **not** make them fully qualified electricians. Candidates must complete the Appendix 2 declaration.
