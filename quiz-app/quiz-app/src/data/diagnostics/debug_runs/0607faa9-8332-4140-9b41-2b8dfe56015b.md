## Issues Targeted

1. **[beginnerClarityStaging: Learning Outcome 4 requires students to 'Select the appropri...]** Learning Outcome 4 requires students to 'Select the appropriate circuit type', which is an 'Apply' level task. However, the lesson lacks a Worked Example or Guided Practice to model this selection process. This creates a sudden jump in complexity from definitions to application.
   - Suggestion: Cannot be fixed by Phase 10 - requires regeneration
   - Points lost: 3, Severity: 3.0

2. **[questions: Integrative block questions (INT-1, INT-2) are set to 'short...]** Integrative block questions (INT-1, INT-2) are set to 'short-text' but require 2-4 sentences of synthesis. This is highly likely to cause grading failures as students will rarely match the 3 provided variations exactly in a long-form response.
   - Suggestion: Cannot be fixed by Phase 10 - requires regeneration
   - Points lost: 3, Severity: 3.0

3. **[beginnerClarityStaging: The explanation at block[3] (order 4) references 'BS 7671 Ch...]** The explanation at block[3] (order 4) references 'BS 7671 Chapter 3' without summarizing the actual rule. Beginners typically do not have the regulations book yet and need the specific rule (division of circuits) explained.
   - Suggestion: Modify blocks[3].content.content
   - Points lost: 2, Severity: 2.0

4. **[beginnerClarityStaging: The term 'Separation of Services' is used as a key takeaway ...]** The term 'Separation of Services' is used as a key takeaway in Explanation 1 and is part of the learning outcomes, but it is missing from the Vocab block.
   - Suggestion: Append to blocks[1].content.terms: '[object Object]'
   - Points lost: 2, Severity: 2.0

5. **[markingRobustness: Practice question 203-3A9-P5 asks for a numeric value but th...]** Practice question 203-3A9-P5 asks for a numeric value but the hint is vague. It should explicitly tell the student to provide the number only to avoid unit-entry errors.
   - Suggestion: Modify blocks[7].content.questions[4].hint
   - Points lost: 1, Severity: 1.0

6. **[visual: Explanation 2 describes Ring and Radial configurations but d...]** Explanation 2 describes Ring and Radial configurations but does not explicitly direct the student to look at the 'Circuit Types' diagram for a visual comparison of the loop vs. line.
   - Suggestion: Prepend to blocks[5].content.content: 'Refer to the diagram to see how a radial circuit forms a line while a ring circuit forms a continuous loop.

'
   - Points lost: 1, Severity: 1.0

7. **[questions: Question 203-3A9-C1-L2 asks for a connection between three d...]** Question 203-3A9-C1-L2 asks for a connection between three different concepts but uses 'short-text'. This is too restrictive for a 'connection' level question.
   - Suggestion: Prepend to blocks[4].content.questions[3].questionText: 'In one concise sentence, '
   - Points lost: 1, Severity: 1.0

## Patches Applied

### 1. Status: applied

- **Op:** prepend
- **Path:** `blocks[5].content.content`
- **Old Value:** `"### In this lesson\n- You will learn to distinguish between the two most common wiring configurations for power circuits: ring and radial.\n- You are in an installation scenario where you must decide which configuration best suits the floor area and expected load of a room.\n- Key takeaways: ring circuits form a continuous loop, radial circuits run in a single line, and spurs provide additional flexibility.\n\n**What this is**\nA **Radial Circuit** is a circuit arrangement where the cable originates from the consumer unit and runs to each point in a continuous line, terminating at the final point. This is the simplest form of wiring. In contrast, a **Ring Final Circuit** is a specific circuit configuration where the conductors form a continuous loop, starting and finishing at the same protective device in the distribution board. This creates two paths for the current to flow to any point on the ring. Often, installers will add a **Spur**, which is a branch cable connected to an existing final circuit to provide power to an additional outlet or point of use without extending the main run.\n\n**Why it matters**\nThe choice between ring and radial configurations affects the amount of cable used, the ease of installation, and the current-carrying capacity of the circuit. A **Ring Final Circuit** allows for a higher total load to be served using smaller conductors because the current is split between two paths. However, it requires careful testing to ensure the loop is continuous. A **Radial Circuit** is often easier to install and troubleshoot, making it common for lighting and dedicated appliance feeds. Explaining the fundamental differences between ring final and radial circuit configurations is essential for any electrician to ensure the circuit is appropriate for the intended use.\n\n**Key facts / rules**\n- A **Ring Final Circuit** must have its ends terminated into the same terminal at the protective device.\n- Continuity of all conductors (line, neutral, and earth) must be maintained throughout a ring.\n- A **Radial Circuit** can serve any number of points, provided the total load does not exceed the protective device rating.\n- A **Spur** can be connected to either a ring or a radial circuit.\n- Unfused spurs on a ring circuit are typically limited to one per point on the ring (refer to IET On-Site Guide for current limits).\n- Radial circuits are the standard choice for lighting and high-power fixed appliances.\n- Ring circuits are commonly used for socket-outlets in UK domestic installations to cover large floor areas.\n\n**When to choose it**\nYou should select a **Ring Final Circuit** when you need to provide power to a large number of socket-outlets over a significant floor area, such as in a domestic kitchen or lounge. The loop configuration is efficient for distributing load. Choose a **Radial Circuit** for lighting, as the loads are smaller and the \"line\" layout is more practical for running between switches and luminaires. Radials are also the preferred choice for dedicated high-power equipment like electric showers or cookers, where a single point of use requires a dedicated supply. You would choose to add a **Spur** when a customer needs one additional socket-outlet in an existing room and it is not practical to break into the main circuit loop or line to extend it.\n\n**Common mistakes**\n- Accidentally creating a \"figure of eight\" or an interconnected loop when installing a **Ring Final Circuit**.\n- Connecting too many **Spur** outlets to a single point, which can overload the local cable section.\n- Failing to verify the continuity of a ring, effectively leaving it as two long radials which can lead to cable overheating.\n- Using a radial configuration for a large floor area without increasing the cable size to account for the total load.\n\n**Key Points**\n- **Radial Circuit**: A straight line from the board to the last point.\n- **Ring Final Circuit**: A continuous loop starting and ending at the board.\n- **Spur**: A branch off an existing circuit for an extra outlet.\n- Selection depends on floor area, load requirements, and ease of installation.\n\n**Quick recap**\nUnderstanding the differences between ring and radial configurations allows an electrician to select the appropriate circuit type for a given installation requirement based on its typical use. While rings are excellent for large areas with many sockets, radials provide simplicity and are ideal for lighting and heavy-duty appliances. Both can be extended using spurs when necessary, provided the rules in BS 7671 (refer to current edition) are followed.\n\n### Coming Up Next\nIn the next lesson, we will explore the specific components found within these circuits, including the protective devices and accessories that make them functional."`

## Postmortem Analysis

**Root Cause:** The score improved because Patch 2 successfully addressed a marking robustness issue by constraining a short-text response. However, the improvement was dampened by Patch 1, which likely introduced a clarity or flow issue by referencing a diagram without ensuring proximity or proper context.

**Harmful Patches:**
- Patch 1: Prepending a visual reference to block[5] caused a significant score drop (-5 sequential). This likely occurred because the reference was either spatially distant from the actual diagram block or created a redundant/clunky transition that violated clarity standards for beginners. (-5 points)

**Recommendations:**
- Update the refinement prompt to mandate that all 'Modify' or 'Append' suggestions from the issue list MUST be attempted unless they conflict with another patch.
- Implement a 'Proximity Check' for visual reference patches: If a patch mentions a 'diagram' or 'image', the system should verify the target block is immediately adjacent to a block of type 'image' or 'diagram'.
- For 'short-text' questions requiring synthesis, the prompt should automatically attempt to add length constraints (e.g., 'In 15 words or less') rather than giving up on the issue.
