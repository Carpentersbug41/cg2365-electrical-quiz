# Phase 10 Debug Report

**Run ID:** 272e4051-9a7f-4cc3-8acb-0be8e5691656
**Lesson:** 202-5B - 202-5B — Magnetic effects of electrical current
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-08T19:07:17.969Z

## Outcome

- **Baseline Score:** 96/100
- **Refined Score:** N/A (Phase 10 not triggered or failed)

## Issues Targeted

1. **[beginnerClarityStaging: Informal definition. City & Guilds 2365 specifically looks f...]** Informal definition. City & Guilds 2365 specifically looks for the concept of 'total energy converted to electrical energy per unit charge'.
   - Suggestion: Change blocks[1].content.terms[0].definition from '[current value]' to 'The total energy supplied by a source (like a battery) per unit of electric charge, representing the 'pressure' available before current flows.'
   - Points lost: 3, Severity: 3.0

2. **[beginnerClarityStaging: The explanation mentions the rule but fails to map the finge...]** The explanation mentions the rule but fails to map the fingers (Thumb, First, Second) to their respective variables.
   - Suggestion: Modify blocks[3].content.content
   - Points lost: 3, Severity: 3.0

3. **[questions: Question 202-5B-P2 asks for 'magnetic flux density', but the...]** Question 202-5B-P2 asks for 'magnetic flux density', but the text only defines 'magnetic flux'.
   - Suggestion: Modify blocks[3].content.content
   - Points lost: 3, Severity: 3.0

4. **[markingRobustness: Synthesis question marking relies on long-string matches whi...]** Synthesis question marking relies on long-string matches which are prone to false negatives.
   - Suggestion: Append to blocks[8].content.questions[1].expectedAnswer: 'EMF drives current through a solenoid and an iron core increases the flux density'
   - Points lost: 3, Severity: 3.0

5. **[beginnerClarityStaging: The term 'Permeability' is used in Explanation 2 but is not ...]** The term 'Permeability' is used in Explanation 2 but is not defined in the vocab section.
   - Suggestion: Append to blocks[1].content.terms: '[object Object]'
   - Points lost: 2, Severity: 2.0

6. **[markingRobustness: The marking is slightly too narrow. A student answering 'it ...]** The marking is slightly too narrow. A student answering 'it increases as current increases' might be marked wrong.
   - Suggestion: Append to blocks[4].content.questions[1].expectedAnswer: 'increases as current increases'
   - Points lost: 2, Severity: 2.0

7. **[beginnerClarityStaging: Does not explicitly mention common non-magnetic metals (Copp...]** Does not explicitly mention common non-magnetic metals (Copper/Aluminium) that electricians handle daily.
   - Suggestion: Modify blocks[5].content.content
   - Points lost: 2, Severity: 2.0

8. **[alignment: The 'Predict' outcome (Outcome 4) is stated but not explicit...]** The 'Predict' outcome (Outcome 4) is stated but not explicitly modeled with a 'what-if' scenario in the text.
   - Suggestion: Append to blocks[3].content.content: '

**Prediction Scenario:** If the current in a motor winding is doubled, the magnetic field strength around those conductors will also double, resulting in significantly more torque (turning force).'
   - Points lost: 2, Severity: 2.0

9. **[questions: The spaced review questions are extremely basic 'Level 1' st...]** The spaced review questions are extremely basic 'Level 1' style recall.
   - Suggestion: Change blocks[9].content.questions[0].questionText from '[current value]' to 'According to Ohm's Law (from earlier in Unit 202), if voltage remains constant and resistance increases, what happens to the current?'
   - Points lost: 2, Severity: 2.0

10. **[beginnerClarityStaging: Missing the key characteristic that it must have 'many turns...]** Missing the key characteristic that it must have 'many turns' to be effective.
   - Suggestion: Modify blocks[1].content.terms[3].definition
   - Points lost: 1, Severity: 1.0
