## Issues Targeted

1. **[markingRobustness: Recall questions 203-3AA-C1-L1-A and 203-3AA-C2-L1-A have ov...]** Recall questions 203-3AA-C1-L1-A and 203-3AA-C2-L1-A have overly lenient expectedAnswer variants (e.g., 'Final Circuit' or 'Radial Circuit') that allow students to pass without actually answering the descriptive part of the question (origin and path).
   - Suggestion: Change blocks[4].content.questions[0].expectedAnswer from 'A Final Circuit is an electrical circuit that originates at a distribution board and supplies current directly to equipment,Final Circuit,a final circuit,final circuit originates at a distribution board' to 'originates at a distribution board and supplies current directly to equipment,starts at the distribution board and supplies equipment,supplies current directly from the distribution board,originates at a distribution board'
   - Points lost: 2, Severity: 2.0

2. **[questions: Connection and Synthesis questions (C1-L2, C2-L2, and the In...]** Connection and Synthesis questions (C1-L2, C2-L2, and the Integrative block) use 'short-text' answerType for responses requiring 2-4 sentences. This makes automated grading fragile and creates a poor student experience.
   - Suggestion: Change blocks[4].content.questions[3].answerType from 'short-text' to 'long-text'
   - Points lost: 2, Severity: 2.0

3. **[beginnerClarityStaging: The spaced-review block at the end of the lesson is empty. E...]** The spaced-review block at the end of the lesson is empty. Even without prerequisites, this block should be used to anchor the most critical concepts of the current lesson (Ring vs Radial) for long-term retention.
   - Suggestion: Change blocks[9].content.questions from '' to '[object Object]'
   - Points lost: 2, Severity: 2.0

## Patches Applied

### 1. Status: applied

- **Op:** replace
- **Path:** `blocks[4].content.questions[0].expectedAnswer`
- **Old Value:** `["A Final Circuit is an electrical circuit that originates at a distribution board and supplies current directly to equipment","Final Circuit","a final circuit","final circuit originates at a distribution board"]`
- **New Value:** `["originates at a distribution board and supplies current directly to equipment","starts at the distribution board and supplies equipment","supplies current directly from the distribution board","originates at a distribution board"]`
- **Reason:** Removed overly lenient variants and updated expectedAnswer to require descriptive details about the circuit's origin and path.
- **Validation:** ✓ targetExists, ✓ fromMatches, ✓ safeStructure, ✓ allowedOp, ✓ allowedPath
- **Isolation (Sequential):** 0 total
- **Isolation (Independent):** +2 total

### 2. Status: applied

- **Op:** replace
- **Path:** `blocks[4].content.questions[3].answerType`
- **Old Value:** `"short-text"`
- **New Value:** `"long-text"`
- **Reason:** Changed answerType to long-text to better accommodate multi-sentence synthesis responses.
- **Validation:** ✓ targetExists, ✓ fromMatches, ✓ safeStructure, ✓ allowedOp, ✓ allowedPath
- **Isolation (Sequential):** -4 total
- **Isolation (Independent):** 0 total

## Postmortem Analysis

**Root Cause:** The refinement failed primarily because Patch 2 changed an answerType to 'long-text' without providing the necessary grading rubric required for that type, leading to a significant sequential score drop. Additionally, the agent failed to generate a patch for the empty spaced-review block despite identifying it as an issue.

**Harmful Patches:**
- Patch 1: Changing 'short-text' to 'long-text' without adding a corresponding 'rubric' or 'gradingCriteria' often causes automated evaluators to penalize the question for being ungradable or incomplete. It also had a -4 point sequential impact. (-4 points)

**Recommendations:**
- Update the refinement prompt to mandate that any change from 'short-text' to 'long-text' must also generate a detailed 'rubric' field for the question.
- Add a validation step to ensure that every 'Issue Targeted' by the analysis phase has at least one corresponding patch in the output.
- Include a specific instruction to fix ID naming conventions (e.g., ensuring IDs follow the 'LessonID-BlockType-Index' pattern) when ID audit issues are detected.
