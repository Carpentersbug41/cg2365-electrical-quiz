# Phase 10 Debug Report

**Run ID:** 4ccd9b03-62a5-4c67-9197-29aaa14c16f0
**Lesson:** 203-3A3 - 203-3A3 — Circuit Types: What They Do
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-07T16:49:49.564Z

## Outcome

- **Baseline Score:** 88/100
- **Refined Score:** N/A (Phase 10 not triggered or failed)

## Issues Targeted

1. **[beginnerClarityStaging: The lesson jumps from simple recall questions in the checks ...]** The lesson jumps from simple recall questions in the checks to high-level synthesis in the integrative block without a worked example or guided practice to model how to construct these complex answers.
   - Suggestion: Cannot be fixed by Phase 10 - requires regeneration
   - Points lost: 4, Severity: 4.0

2. **[markingRobustness: Expected answers for recall questions (e.g., 203-3A3-C1-L1-A...]** Expected answers for recall questions (e.g., 203-3A3-C1-L1-A) include redundant prompt text ('Final Circuit is defined as...'), which creates high friction for short-text matching.
   - Suggestion: Change blocks[4].content.questions[0].expectedAnswer from 'Final Circuit is defined as a circuit connected directly from a consumer unit or distribution board to current-using equipment,final circuit,final circuits' to 'final circuit,final circuits,a final circuit'
   - Points lost: 3, Severity: 3.0

3. **[questions: Independent practice question P1 is virtually identical to c...]** Independent practice question P1 is virtually identical to check question C1-L1-A, providing no new context or application for the student to test their understanding.
   - Suggestion: Change blocks[7].content.questions[0].questionText from 'Identify the type of circuit that connects directly from a consumer unit or distribution board to current-using equipment.' to 'An electrician is wiring a dedicated feed for a new electric oven; what is the general term for this type of circuit connected directly from the consumer unit?'
   - Points lost: 3, Severity: 3.0

4. **[visual: The explanation blocks (4 and 6) do not explicitly reference...]** The explanation blocks (4 and 6) do not explicitly reference the diagram provided in block 3, missing an opportunity to anchor the text to the visual representation.
   - Suggestion: Modify blocks[3].content.content
   - Points lost: 2, Severity: 2.0

5. **[beginnerClarityStaging: Technical terms 'BS 7671' and 'Extra-low voltage (ELV)' are ...]** Technical terms 'BS 7671' and 'Extra-low voltage (ELV)' are introduced in the text but are missing from the Vocab block, which may confuse beginners.
   - Suggestion: Append to blocks[1].content.terms: '[object Object],[object Object]'
   - Points lost: 2, Severity: 2.0

6. **[questions: Connection-level questions at 203-3A3-C1-L2 and 203-3A3-C2-L...]** Connection-level questions at 203-3A3-C1-L2 and 203-3A3-C2-L2 lack formatting instructions (e.g., 'Answer in 1-2 sentences'), which can lead to overly brief or long-winded student responses.
   - Suggestion: Append to blocks[4].content.questions[3].questionText: ' (Answer in 2-3 sentences or concise bullet points.)'
   - Points lost: 2, Severity: 2.0
