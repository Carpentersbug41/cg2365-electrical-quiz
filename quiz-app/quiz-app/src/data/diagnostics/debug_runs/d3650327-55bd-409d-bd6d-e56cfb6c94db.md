## Issues Targeted

1. **[markingRobustness: Check blocks at blocks[4] and blocks[6] (Question 4) use com...]** Check blocks at blocks[4] and blocks[6] (Question 4) use complex, multi-clause sentences as expected answers for short-text fields. This is nearly impossible for students to match exactly, leading to false negatives.
   - Suggestion: Change blocks[4].content.questions[3].expectedAnswer from 'A Final Circuit is the fundamental building block of an installation, which may be a Control Circuit is used to regulate the operation of equipment or a Data Circuit is a low-voltage system dedicated to digital or analogue signals.' to 'final circuits include control and data types,final circuits can be for control or data,final circuits serve different purposes like control or data'
   - Points lost: 3, Severity: 3.0

2. **[markingRobustness: Integrative block at blocks[8] contains paragraph-length exp...]** Integrative block at blocks[8] contains paragraph-length expected answers (3-4 sentences) for 'short-text' fields. Short-text types are unsuitable for essay-style synthesis; they will fail to grade correctly.
   - Suggestion: Change blocks[8].content.questions[0].expectedAnswer from 'The purpose of the circuit dictates the expected current demand, where lighting circuits use radial configurations because they typically handle lower, distributed loads. In contrast, power circuits often utilize ring final configurations to allow higher current loads to be shared across two cable paths, ensuring the circuit can safely power multiple heavy appliances.,Circuit categories like lighting are usually wired as radials because the total load is relatively low, whereas power socket circuits may use ring final configurations to increase current carrying capacity. The choice of configuration is directly linked to whether the circuit's purpose requires the high-capacity load distribution provided by a ring or the simpler path of a radial.' to 'Load demand determines the configuration,Higher loads like sockets use rings while lower loads use radials,Current demand dictates if a ring or radial is used'
   - Points lost: 3, Severity: 3.0

3. **[questions: Questions at blocks[4]/questions[3] and blocks[6]/questions[...]** Questions at blocks[4]/questions[3] and blocks[6]/questions[3] use meta-referential wording ('Using your answers to Q1, Q2, and Q3...'). This is fragile in digital learning environments where question order or visibility may vary.
   - Suggestion: Change blocks[4].content.questions[3].questionText from 'Using your answers to Q1 (building blocks), Q2 (regulating equipment), and Q3 (digital signals), explain how these circuit types relate to one another in a building.' to 'Explain how the 'final circuit' concept encompasses specialized types like control and data circuits within a building.'
   - Points lost: 2, Severity: 2.0

4. **[markingRobustness: Numeric questions at blocks[7] include '.0' variations in ex...]** Numeric questions at blocks[7] include '.0' variations in expectedAnswer despite the prompt explicitly asking for a 'whole number'. This is redundant and can occasionally cause float-matching issues in some engines.
   - Suggestion: Change blocks[7].content.questions[0].expectedAnswer from '32,32.0' to '32'
   - Points lost: 1, Severity: 1.0

## Postmortem Analysis

**Root Cause:** The primary cause of the score decline was Patch 1, where the attempt to improve 'marking robustness' resulted in an over-simplification of the expected answer, stripping away essential technical definitions (e.g., 'fundamental building block', 'digital or analogue signals') that the pedagogy likely required.

**Harmful Patches:**
- Patch 0: The patch replaced a detailed technical definition with vague summaries. While more 'markable', it lost the specific terminology ('building block', 'regulating equipment') that defined the learning objective for that question, leading to a significant drop in alignment or depth scores. (-6 points)
- Patch 3: While it had a positive independent impact, its negative sequential impact suggests that in the context of the already-weakened lesson (after Patch 1), removing answer variations further reduced the 'coverage' score of the assessment block. (-2 points)

**Recommendations:**
- Implement a 'Key Term Retention' rule: When simplifying expected answers for robustness, the system must identify and preserve technical keywords (e.g., 'fundamental building block', 'digital signals').
- Adjust Short-Text Thresholds: Provide guidance that 'short-text' fields can handle up to 20-30 words; if an answer requires more, the recommendation should be to split the question or change the question type rather than gutting the answer content.
- Refine Patch 1 Suggestions: Instead of replacing the whole sentence with a vague list, suggest 2-3 variations that each contain the core technical truth in different phrasing.
