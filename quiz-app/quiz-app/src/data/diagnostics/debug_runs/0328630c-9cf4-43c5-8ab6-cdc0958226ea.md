## Issues Targeted

1. **[questions: Spaced review contains content taught in the current lesson ...]** Spaced review contains content taught in the current lesson (Frequency/Hertz).
   - Suggestion: Change blocks[11].content.questions[2] from '[current value]' to '[object Object]'
   - Points lost: 3, Severity: 3.0

2. **[alignment: Worked example steps use a practical task template that does...]** Worked example steps use a practical task template that doesn't fit a science theory context.
   - Suggestion: Change blocks[7].content.steps[0].description from '[current value]' to 'Identify the physical position of the loop relative to the magnetic field.'
   - Points lost: 3, Severity: 3.0

3. **[markingRobustness: Numeric answer type will mark a student wrong if they includ...]** Numeric answer type will mark a student wrong if they include the unit (Hz or s).
   - Suggestion: Change blocks[9].content.questions[0].answerType from '[current value]' to 'short-text'
   - Points lost: 3, Severity: 3.0

4. **[beginnerClarityStaging: Missing explicit formula for RMS and Average values (0.707 a...]** Missing explicit formula for RMS and Average values (0.707 and 0.637).
   - Suggestion: Modify blocks[5].content.content
   - Points lost: 2, Severity: 2.0

5. **[markingRobustness: Expected answers are too wordy for a short-text field.]** Expected answers are too wordy for a short-text field.
   - Suggestion: Append to blocks[4].content.questions[0].expectedAnswer: 'magnetic flux cutting'
   - Points lost: 2, Severity: 2.0

6. **[markingRobustness: Missing the key technical term 'perpendicular' in the expect...]** Missing the key technical term 'perpendicular' in the expected answers.
   - Suggestion: Append to blocks[9].content.questions[3].expectedAnswer: 'perpendicular'
   - Points lost: 2, Severity: 2.0

7. **[beginnerClarityStaging: Vocab list is missing 'Magnetic Flux' despite it being a pre...]** Vocab list is missing 'Magnetic Flux' despite it being a prerequisite concept for the lesson.
   - Suggestion: Append to blocks[1].content.terms: '[object Object]'
   - Points lost: 2, Severity: 2.0

8. **[beginnerClarityStaging: The text links vertical/horizontal to peak/zero but doesn't ...]** The text links vertical/horizontal to peak/zero but doesn't explicitly state the degrees in this specific paragraph.
   - Suggestion: Modify blocks[3].content.content
   - Points lost: 2, Severity: 2.0

9. **[markingRobustness: Missing 'Period' as a valid synonym.]** Missing 'Period' as a valid synonym.
   - Suggestion: Append to blocks[6].content.questions[1].expectedAnswer: 'period'
   - Points lost: 1, Severity: 1.0

10. **[markingRobustness: The integrative question expected answer for RMS uses 'pract...]** The integrative question expected answer for RMS uses 'practical calculations' but the question asks for 'effective value'.
   - Suggestion: Modify blocks[10].content.questions[1].expectedAnswer[1]
   - Points lost: 1, Severity: 1.0
