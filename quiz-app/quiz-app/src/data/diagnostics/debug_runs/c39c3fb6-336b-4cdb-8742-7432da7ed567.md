# Phase 10 Debug Report

**Run ID:** c39c3fb6-336b-4cdb-8742-7432da7ed567
**Lesson:** 203-3A2 - 203-3A2 — Circuit Types: What They Do
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-07T08:50:21.660Z

## Outcome

- **Baseline Score:** 94/100
- **Refined Score:** N/A (Phase 10 not triggered or failed)

## Issues Targeted

1. **[markingRobustness: Integrative block at blocks[8] uses 'short-text' answerType ...]** Integrative block at blocks[8] uses 'short-text' answerType for questions requiring 2-4 sentences. This will cause high failure rates as student responses are unlikely to match the multi-sentence expectedAnswer strings.
   - Suggestion: Cannot be fixed by Phase 10 - requires regeneration
   - Points lost: 5, Severity: 5.0

2. **[markingRobustness: Check blocks at blocks[4] and blocks[6] use rigid, sentence-...]** Check blocks at blocks[4] and blocks[6] use rigid, sentence-length expectedAnswer strings that include the question premise (e.g., 'Final Circuit is defined as...'). This makes the auto-grading brittle.
   - Suggestion: Change blocks[4].content.questions[0].expectedAnswer from '[current value]' to 'circuit connected directly from a distribution board,connected directly from a distribution board to equipment,provides electricity from a distribution board'
   - Points lost: 4, Severity: 4.0

3. **[visual: The explanation block at blocks[5] describes radial and ring...]** The explanation block at blocks[5] describes radial and ring layouts in detail but fails to explicitly reference the comparison diagram provided in blocks[2].
   - Suggestion: Modify blocks[5].content.content
   - Points lost: 2, Severity: 2.0
