# Phase 10 Debug Report

**Run ID:** 1263df50-4c53-48ae-9078-2d9d65d31388
**Lesson:** 203-3A1 - 203-3A1 — Circuit Types: What They Do
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-07T11:04:45.773Z

## Outcome

- **Baseline Score:** 94/100
- **Refined Score:** N/A (Phase 10 not triggered or failed)

## Issues Targeted

1. **[markingRobustness: Questions 203-3A1-C1-L2, 203-3A1-C2-L2, 203-3A1-INT-1, and 2...]** Questions 203-3A1-C1-L2, 203-3A1-C2-L2, 203-3A1-INT-1, and 203-3A1-INT-2 require multi-sentence synthesis but are set to 'short-text'. This breaks the grading contract as short-text cannot reliably grade paragraph-length responses.
   - Suggestion: Cannot be fixed by Phase 10 - requires regeneration
   - Points lost: 3, Severity: 3.0

2. **[visual: Explanation blocks at [3] and [5] describe circuit topologie...]** Explanation blocks at [3] and [5] describe circuit topologies but never explicitly reference the diagram block at [2]. Beginners benefit from 'See Figure X' cues to connect text to visuals.
   - Suggestion: Modify blocks[3].content.content
   - Points lost: 2, Severity: 2.0

3. **[markingRobustness: The expectedAnswer fields for recall questions (e.g., 203-3A...]** The expectedAnswer fields for recall questions (e.g., 203-3A1-C1-L1-A) contain full verbatim sentences. Short-text matching is more robust when targeting core technical phrases.
   - Suggestion: Change blocks[4].content.questions[0].expectedAnswer from 'Final Circuit is a circuit intended to supply electrical energy directly to current-using equipment,final circuit is a circuit intended to supply electrical energy directly to current-using equipment,final circuits are circuits intended to supply electrical energy directly to current-using equipment' to 'supply electrical energy directly to current-using equipment,supply energy to equipment or socket-outlets,supply current-using equipment'
   - Points lost: 2, Severity: 2.0

4. **[beginnerClarityStaging: Spaced review note at blocks[9] says 'before starting', whic...]** Spaced review note at blocks[9] says 'before starting', which is confusing since the block appears at the end of the lesson.
   - Suggestion: Modify blocks[9].content.notes
   - Points lost: 1, Severity: 1.0
