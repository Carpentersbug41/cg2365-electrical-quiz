    "question": "In a complex industrial installation, why is a mechanical conduit bender required for 20mm galvanised steel conduit rather than a manual internal bending spring?",
    "options": [
      "Steel conduit is too rigid to be manipulated by a manual spring and requires mechanical advantage.",
      "Bending springs are only designed for use with cable tray systems.",
      "The mechanical bender automatically threads the conduit while the bend is being formed.",
      "Steel conduit requires heat treatment which can only be applied by a bender."

    "question": "What is the primary technical advantage of using a tray bender to create an offset in a cable tray installation rather than using 'cut and bolt' methods?",
    "options": [
      "It maintains the physical continuity of the tray and minimizes sharp edges.",
      "It eliminates the requirement for protective earthing of the containment system.",
      "It allows the cables within the tray to operate at a higher voltage.",

    "question": "Why is it standard practice to 'back-off' (rotate anti-clockwise) the stocks and dies every half-turn while threading steel conduit?",
    "options": [
      "To break off the metal swarf and prevent the die from jamming.",
      "To allow the conduit to cool down to prevent thermal expansion.",

      "Steel conduit requires a mechanical bender with a fixed former, whereas PVC uses an internal spring.",
      "PVC conduit requires the use of stocks and dies to create threaded joints for couplers.",
