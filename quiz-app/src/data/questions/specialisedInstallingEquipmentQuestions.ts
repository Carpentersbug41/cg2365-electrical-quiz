    "question": "Why is it standard practice to rotate a stock and die half a turn backwards for every full turn forwards when threading a conduit?",
    "options": [
      "To break off the metal 'swarf' and prevent the die from jamming",
      "To allow the cutting compound to reach the center of the conduit",
      "To ensure the thread is cut to a parallel rather than a tapered profile",
      "To prevent the conduit from over-heating and losing its temper"

    "question": "When setting up a pillar-type conduit bender for a 'bubble' or 'offset' bend, what is the role of the 'stop block' (also known as the 'steady')?",
    "options": [
      "To hold the conduit firmly in place while the former applies pressure",
      "To measure the exact angle of the bend being produced",
      "To prevent the operator from pulling the handle too far",
      "To mark the conduit where the next bend should start"

      "A portable, manual tool used for making small adjustments or bends in situ",
      "A hydraulic-powered machine used for large diameter 50mm conduits",
      "A specialized tool used exclusively for bending PVC conduit with heat",
      "A fixed workshop tool used for threading rather than bending"

    "question": "An electrician is using a stock and die set and finds that the resulting threads are too loose, causing the coupling to wobble. How should the specialized equipment be adjusted to rectify this on the next cut?",
    "options": [
      "Tighten the adjustment screws on the die within the stock to bring the cutting teeth closer together",
      "Increase the amount of cutting compound used during the process",
      "Decrease the pressure applied to the handles of the stock",

    "question": "In the context of cable management systems, what is the specific purpose of a 'conduit reamer' used after a pipe cutter has been employed?",
    "options": [
      "To remove the internal sharp burr that could strip insulation during cable drawing",
      "To expand the end of the conduit so it fits over a coupling without threads",
      "To clean the internal surface of the conduit to improve earth continuity",
      "To create a tapered lead-in for the threading die on the outside of the pipe"
