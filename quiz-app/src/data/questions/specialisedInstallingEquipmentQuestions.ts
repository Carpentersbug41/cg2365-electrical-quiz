    "question": "When threading steel conduit, why is it standard practice to rotate the stock backwards by a quarter-turn for every half-turn forward?",
    "options": [
      "To break off the metal swarf and prevent it from clogging the die teeth",
      "To check that the guide is still aligned with the conduit axis",
      "To allow the cutting oil to penetrate deeper into the conduit wall",

    "options": [
      "To create uniform internal or external bends in heavy-duty cable tray without cutting the side flanges",
      "To straighten out lengths of cable tray that have been damaged during delivery",
      "To punch holes for 20mm conduit entries into the side of the cable tray",

    "question": "What is the primary reason for using a 'pipe vice' on a stand rather than a standard bench vice when threading long lengths of steel conduit?",
    "options": [
      "The serrated jaws of the pipe vice provide a 360-degree grip that prevents the round conduit from rotating",
      "The pipe vice is made of softer material to prevent marking the galvanised finish",
      "A pipe vice is specifically designed to bend the conduit while it is being threaded",
      "The stand allows the conduit to be held at a 45-degree angle to aid oil flow"

    "options": [
      "A hydraulic bender with a 32mm former",
      "A 32mm internal bending spring and a blow lamp",
      "A larger guide for the 25mm former to accommodate the 32mm pipe",

    "options": [
      "To provide a path for cutting lubricant to reach the cutting edges and for swarf to escape",
      "To allow the operative to see the conduit clearly as it enters the die",
      "To reduce the overall weight of the stock and die assembly for easier transport",
