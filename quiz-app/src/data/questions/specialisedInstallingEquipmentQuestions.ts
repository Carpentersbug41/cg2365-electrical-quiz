    "options": [
      "To distribute pressure evenly along the conduit to prevent flattening during the bend.",
      "To lock the conduit into the former so it cannot move vertically.",
      "To measure the exact angle of the bend as it is being formed.",

    "options": [
      "To remove internal burrs that could damage cable insulation during drawing-in.",
      "To widen the external diameter so the die can start cutting the thread.",
      "To clean off the galvanized coating to prevent the die from slipping.",

    "question": "What is the primary conceptual reason for using 'tallow' or 'cutting oil' when using stocks and dies on steel conduit?",
    "options": [
      "To reduce friction and heat, extending the life of the cutting teeth and improving thread quality.",
      "To act as a temporary adhesive for the coupler once the thread is finished.",
