    "options": [
      "To break off the metal swarf and prevent the die from clogging or jamming",
      "To allow the cutting oil to be sucked deeper into the conduit threads",

      "The diameter of the cut can be slightly adjusted using a grub screw in the stock",
      "They are made of high-speed steel (HSS) whereas solid dies are always carbon steel",

    "question": "What is the likely consequence of using a 25mm former on a conduit bender to bend 20mm galvanised steel conduit?",
    "options": [
      "The conduit will flatten because the groove in the former is too wide to support the side walls",
      "The bend will be successful but the radius will be larger than required by BS 7671",
      "The conduit will snap instantly because the 25mm former applies too much tension",

      "The V-shaped serrated jaws provide multiple points of contact to prevent the conduit from rotating",
      "The pipe vice is made of plastic to prevent scratching the galvanised surface",

      "Insufficient use of cutting compound or tallow during the threading process",
      "The conduit was cut with a hacksaw instead of a tube cutter",
