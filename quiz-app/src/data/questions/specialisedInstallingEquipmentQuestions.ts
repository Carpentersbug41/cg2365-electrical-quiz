    "question": "In a large industrial installation involving 32mm heavy-gauge steel conduit, why is a hydraulic bender often specified over a standard manual stand-mounted bender?",
    "options": [
      "The physical force required to bend 32mm steel exceeds safe manual handling limits",
      "Hydraulic benders are the only tools that can create 90-degree bends",
      "Manual benders cannot be used on galvanised finishes due to friction",
      "The hydraulic fluid acts as a necessary lubricant for the former during the bend"

      "To measure the angle of the bend as it progresses",
