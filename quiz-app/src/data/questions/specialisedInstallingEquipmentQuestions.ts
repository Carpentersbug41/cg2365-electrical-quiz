      "It provides a fixed radius template that prevents the tube from kinking or collapsing during the bend",
      "It acts as a measuring gauge to ensure the thread length matches the coupler depth",
      "It is a specialized blade used to score the conduit before a manual snap-cut is made",
      "It is a heat-treated sleeve used to soften PVC conduit before manual manipulation"

    "question": "A trainee electrician attempts to use a standard conduit bender to create a 90-degree bend in a section of medium-duty cable tray. Why is this choice of equipment technically incorrect?",
    "options": [
      "The conduit bender is designed for cylindrical profiles and cannot accommodate the flat geometry of tray",
      "Conduit benders are only rated for use with PVC materials, whereas tray is always metallic",
      "The former in a conduit bender would cause the cable tray to become magnetized",
      "Cable tray is designed to be cut and bolted, and should never be bent using any specialized tool"

    "question": "Failure to use the correct specialized equipment when preparing steel conduit can lead to 'kinking'. What is the most likely consequence of a kinked conduit in a completed installation?",
    "options": [
      "The internal space is restricted, making it difficult or impossible to pull cables through without damage",
      "The conduit will lose its galvanization and immediately begin to corrode at the kink point",
      "The electrical resistance of the steel will increase, causing the conduit to overheat during normal operation",

      "Metallic systems rely on threaded mechanical joints for both physical strength and circuit protective bonding",
      "PVC conduit is too brittle to withstand the high temperatures generated by the threading process",
      "Stocks and dies are used to strip the insulation off cables, which is not required in PVC systems",
