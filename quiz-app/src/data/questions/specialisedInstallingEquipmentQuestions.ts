    "question": "When setting up a stand-mounted bender for 20mm conduit, the electrician notices the 'stop' or 'hook' is loose. What is the most likely consequence of continuing to use the tool in this condition?",
    "options": [
      "The conduit will slip during the bend, resulting in an inaccurate or flattened profile",
      "The mechanical advantage will be increased, making the bend too easy to over-shoot",
      "The conduit will be automatically threaded as it rotates against the former",

    "question": "A student attempts to bend 25mm steel conduit using a 20mm former on a stand-mounted bender. What is the most likely physical outcome of this action?",
    "options": [
      "The conduit will kink and flatten because the former groove is too narrow to support the side walls",
      "The bend will be successful but will have a much smaller radius than intended",
      "The conduit will crack due to the increased leverage required for the larger diameter",
      "The former will shatter because it is not rated for the higher tensile strength of 25mm steel"

      "The conduit has not been earthed before the threading process",
