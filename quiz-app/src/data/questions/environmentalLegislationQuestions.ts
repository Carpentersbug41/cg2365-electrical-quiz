    "question": "While the Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations are primarily for worker health, why are they also classified as environmental legislation in the context of electrical installation work?",
    "options": [
      "Because the improper disturbance of asbestos fibers leads to long-term contamination of the air and soil.",
      "Because asbestos is a natural material that must be returned to the ground.",
      "Because asbestos fibers react with CO2 to cause global warming.",
      "Because the regulations mandate the use of electric vehicles for asbestos transport."
