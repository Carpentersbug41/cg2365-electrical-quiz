    "question": "When following the standard sequence of dead tests for a new ring final circuit, why is 'Continuity of Protective Conductors' performed before 'Insulation Resistance'?",
    "options": [
      "To ensure an effective earth path exists to safely discharge the IR test voltage and protect the tester",
      "Because Insulation Resistance testing requires the circuit to be energised first",
      "To verify that the circuit breaker is correctly rated for the ring main",

      "It is the only time the electrician is legally allowed to touch the cables",
