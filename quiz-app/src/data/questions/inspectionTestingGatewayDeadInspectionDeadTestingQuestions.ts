    "question": "An electrician is conducting a continuity test on a ring final circuit. The end-to-end resistance of the line loop (r1) is 0.45 Ω, but the neutral loop (rn) measures 1.25 Ω. What does this discrepancy most likely indicate?",
    "options": [
      "A high-resistance joint or a loose termination on the neutral conductor within the ring",
      "The neutral conductor is naturally higher in resistance than the line conductor in all rings",
      "A bridge has been installed between the line and neutral conductors at a socket outlet",
      "The circuit is too long and requires a larger cross-sectional area for the neutral conductor"
