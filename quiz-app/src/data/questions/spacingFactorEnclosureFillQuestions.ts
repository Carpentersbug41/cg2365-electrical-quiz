    "explanation": "The factor system accounts for 'draw-in' difficulty. As runs get longer or more complex (bends), the friction increases; therefore, the system effectively 'penalizes' the cable by giving it a higher factor, forcing the use of a larger conduit."

    "explanation": "The total cable factor (480) must not exceed the conduit factor. Since 480 is greater than the 460 factor provided by a 20mm conduit, the electrician must select the next size up, which is 25mm (factor 800)."
