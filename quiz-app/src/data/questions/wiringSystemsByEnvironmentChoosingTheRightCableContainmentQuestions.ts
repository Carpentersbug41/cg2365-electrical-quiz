    "question": "Which of the following justifications correctly follows the professional model for selecting a wiring system for an outdoor car park lighting circuit?",
    "options": [
      "SWA is chosen because the route is exposed to impact and weather, providing mechanical and environmental protection",
      "Twin and Earth is chosen because it is the most cost-effective cable and the car park is a budget project",
      "PVC singles are chosen because they are easier to pull through conduit in any weather condition",

      "The steel wires act as the main live conductor to increase total current capacity",

      "Standards for sheath colours may vary or be specific to the site's own safety coding and age",
      "Chemical vapours always cause all cable sheaths to turn grey over a short period of time",
