They observe that the four-core cable entering the intermediate switch has no green/yellow sleeving on the bare CPC, but it is terminated in the backbox. What is the immediate consequence for the testing sequence?",
    "options": [
      "The inspection fails; the fault must be rectified before any electrical meter testing begins.",
      "The inspection passes as long as the CPC is physically connected to the terminal.",
      "The inspection can be marked as 'not applicable' and the electrician should proceed to the Continuity test.",
      "The fault should be noted on the certificate, but testing can proceed to check if the circuit is safe."
