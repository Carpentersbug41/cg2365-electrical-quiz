    "options": [
      "Clarify that transformers require a changing magnetic field produced by AC to induce a secondary voltage",
      "Explain that DC voltage is too low to overcome the primary winding resistance",
      "State that the RMS value of a battery is zero, making calculation impossible",

    "options": [
      "The iron core changes shape slightly due to the alternating magnetic field 100 times per second",
      "The secondary windings are vibrating because the RMS voltage is too high for the load",
