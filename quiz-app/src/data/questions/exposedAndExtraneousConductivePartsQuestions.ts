    "question": "An electrician is testing a metal radiator in a bathroom. The radiator is connected via plastic Hep2O pipes, but the radiator itself is metallic. Under what condition would this radiator be classified as an extraneous conductive part?",
    "options": [
      "Only if its resistance to the Main Earthing Terminal (MET) is low enough to introduce Earth potential (typically less than 22kΩ)",
      "Always, because all metal objects in a bathroom must be bonded regardless of the pipe material",
      "Only if it is within 2.5 meters of a light switch or a socket outlet",
      "Never, because plastic piping acts as an insulator and prevents the radiator from being part of the electrical system"

    "options": [
      "It must be treated as an extraneous conductive part and bonded to the MET",
      "No action is required because the resistance is above the 0.05Ω continuity limit",
