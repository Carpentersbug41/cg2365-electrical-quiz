    "explanation": "In a ring final circuit, the resistance at the furthest point (R1) is 1/4 of the end-to-end resistance (r1). This is because the two paths to the furthest point are in parallel, each being half the total length (r1/2), and the parallel resistance of two equal resistors is half of one resistor ( (r1/2) / 2 = r1/4 )."
