    "options": [
      "The load current is shared between two parallel paths, reducing the current in any one part of the ring",
      "The ring topology naturally doubles the cross-sectional area of the cable to 5.0mm²",
      "The use of a 32A breaker is only permitted if the circuit length is less than 50 metres",
      "The 1.5mm² CPC provides additional heat dissipation for the phase conductor"
