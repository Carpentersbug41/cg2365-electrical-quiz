        "title": "Understanding and Applying Scale",
        "content": "**What this is**\nScale is the mathematical ratio between a measurement on a technical drawing and the actual size of that object in the real world. In electrical installation, plans are rarely drawn full size because a building is too large for a sheet of paper. Instead, we shrink dimensions proportionally. A scale of 1:50 means that the real building is 50 times larger than the drawing in your hand.\n\n**Why it matters**\nElectricians use scales to set out an installation accurately. This involves taking measurements from a plan and marking the exact positions of socket outlets, light switches, and containment runs on site. If you misread the scale, your accessories will be in the wrong place, cable runs will be too short, and materials will be wasted. Accurate scaling ensures you order the correct amount of conduit, tray, and cable, preventing costly delays.\n\n**Key rules / facts**\n- **1:50 Scale:** 1 unit on paper = 50 units in reality. Multiply the drawing measurement by 50 to find the real size.\n- **1:100 Scale:** 1 unit on paper = 100 units in reality. Multiply the drawing measurement by 100 to find the real size.\n- **Drawing to Real:** Always **multiply** by the scale factor.\n- **Real to Drawing:** Always **divide** by the scale factor.\n- **Unit Consistency:** Always work in the same units (usually millimetres) during the calculation to avoid errors.\n\n**How to use it**\n1. Measure the distance on the drawing using a ruler and record it in millimetres (mm).\n2. Identify the scale factor from the drawing title block (e.g., 50 or 100).\n3. Multiply your measurement by that scale factor to get the real-world size in millimetres.\n4. Divide by 1000 to convert that real-world measurement into metres (m) for marking on site.\n\n**Common mistakes**\n- Using the wrong scale factor, such as multiplying by 100 for a 1:50 drawing.\n- Mixing units, like multiplying millimetres by the scale and assuming the result is already in metres.\n- Forgetting that 1:100 makes objects appear smaller on paper than 1:50.\n\n**Quick recap**\n- Scale is a ratio of Drawing : Real.\n- To go from drawing to site: **Multiply** by the scale factor.\n- To go from site to drawing: **Divide** by the scale factor."
