        "title": "Categorizing Your Findings",
        "content": "During a dead inspection, you are not just looking; you are making decisions that impact safety and the validity of your future tests. Every observation must fall into one of three categories:\n\n1. **Pass**: The installation meets all safety and workmanship standards. Terminations are tight, insulation is intact, CPCs are present and sleeved, and the correct accessories are used.\n\n2. **Suspicious**: These are 'yellow flag' issues. For example, a slightly discolored conductor or a missing circuit label. These don&apos;t necessarily make the rig unsafe to touch, but they must be noted. A suspicious termination might lead to an unstable resistance reading later.\n\n3. **Stop-and-Fix**: These are 'red flag' issues that halt all work. You must **never** proceed to meter testing if you find:\n- **Exposed copper** outside of a terminal (shock risk).\n- **Missing CPC** at any point (no path to earth).\n- **Damaged insulation** where the conductor is visible.\n- **Loose terminations** that could fall out or cause a fire.\n\n**The Inspection Order**\nTo ensure nothing is missed, always follow a consistent sequence: Start at the **supply point** (consumer unit/isolator), move to the **switch points**, and finally to the **light points** or sockets. At each point, check the cable condition and the quality of the terminations.\n\n**Recording Findings**\nWriting &quot;it looks dodgy&quot; is not acceptable. A professional record must state:\n- **What** is wrong (e.g., &quot;Insulation stripped back too far&quot;).\n- **Where** it is (e.g., &quot;L1 terminal at the 1-gang switch&quot;).\n- **Action** taken (e.g., &quot;Re-terminated conductor to remove exposed copper&quot;).\n\nLinking inspection to testing is vital. If you see a conductor that is barely held in by the screw, you should expect a **high or fluctuating resistance reading** during your continuity tests. Identifying this now saves hours of troubleshooting later."
