        "content": "### Who walks through the gate?\nOn any technical site, you will see people who don't work there every day. These are **Site Visitors**. It is critical to know who they are because some can only *ask* for things, while others can *order* you to stop working.\n\nWe divide visitors into two main groups:\n\n1.  **Non-Statutory (Contractual) Visitors**\n    *   **Who:** Clients (owners), Architects, Suppliers.\n    *   **Power:** They rely on the **contract**. The Client pays for the work, so they can request changes to the design or color. However, they **cannot** force you to break the law or safety rules.\n\n2.  **Statutory Inspectors**\n    *   **Who:** Building Control Officers, HSE Inspectors, Water/Electrical Inspectors.\n    *   **Power:** They rely on the **law** (Statutory Authority). They do not care about the contract or deadlines. They only care if the work is legal and safe.\n\n### The Referee Analogy\nThink of a construction site like a football match:\n*   The **Site Manager** is like the **Team Coach**. They want the team to win (finish the job) and play well.\n*   The **Client** is like the **Team Owner**. They pay the players and want a good result.\n*   The **Statutory Inspector** is the **Referee**. The Referee doesn't care who wins; they only care that the **rules** are followed. If the Referee sees a dangerous foul, they can stop the game immediately. The Coach (Site Manager) cannot overrule the Referee.\n\n### Why it matters\nIf a **Client** asks you to move a socket because it looks better, you check with your manager. If a **Statutory Inspector** tells you to stop because the socket is dangerous, you must stop immediately. The law overrides the contract."

Building Control Officer (The Structure)\n*   **Focus:** The building itself.\n*   **Checks:** Foundations, structural walls, fire escapes, insulation, and accessibility.\n*   **Goal:** To ensure the building is safe to occupy and meets **Building Regulations**.\n*   **Example:** A Building Control Officer checks if a steel beam is strong enough to hold the roof.\n\n#### 2. HSE Inspector (The Safety)\n*   **Focus:** The people and the process.\n*   **Checks:** PPE (helmets/boots), scaffolding safety, asbestos risks, and welfare facilities (toilets/water).\n*   **Goal:** To prevent accidents and injury to workers.\n*   **Power:** They can issue a **Prohibition Notice** to stop dangerous work immediately.\n*   **Example:** An HSE Inspector visits to check if workers in a trench are protected from it collapsing.\n\n#### 3. Utility Inspectors (The Systems)\n*   **Water Inspector:** Checks plumbing to prevent contamination of the public water supply (e.g., backflow).\n*   **Electrical Inspector:** Verifies that wiring is safe and meets national standards (e.g., BS 7671).\n\n### The Car Analogy\n*   **Building Control** is like the **MOT Test**. It checks if the car (building) is built correctly and is roadworthy.\n*   **The HSE** is like the **Police**. They check if you are driving safely (working safely) and wearing your seatbelt (PPE). \n\n### Micro-Scenario\nImagine you are installing a bathroom.\n*   A **Water Inspector** checks that the pipes won't poison the mains water.\n*   A **Building Control Officer** checks that the floor is strong enough to hold the bath.\n*   An **HSE Inspector** checks that you are wearing eye protection while cutting the tiles."
