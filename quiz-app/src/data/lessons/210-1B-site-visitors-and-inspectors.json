The chefs (operatives) know exactly where the hot pans and sharp knives are. A customer (visitor) walking in does not know these risks and could easily get hurt. Because of this, we treat **Site Visitors** differently from the permanent workforce.\n\n**Who are they?**\n*   **Clients:** The people paying for the project. They visit to see progress but often lack technical safety knowledge.\n*   **Architects:** Designers who visit to check if the building matches their drawings.\n*   **Delivery Personnel:** Drivers bringing materials. They often only need access to a loading bay, not the whole site.\n\n**Key Safety Rules for Visitors**\n1.  **Site Induction:** Before stepping past the reception, every visitor must receive a briefing on *this specific site's* hazards. A general safety card isn't enough because it doesn't tell them about the open trench dug this morning.\n2.  **The Logbook (In and Out):** In an emergency like a fire, the manager needs a perfect headcount. Visitors must sign **IN** when they arrive and **OUT** when they leave. If they forget to sign out, firefighters might search a burning building for someone who is already at home.\n3.  **Escorts:** Most visitors must be escorted by a competent person to ensure they don't wander into danger.\n\n**Micro-Scenario**\nA delivery driver arrives with a pallet of bricks. Even though he is only there for 10 minutes, he is a 'visitor'. He must sign the logbook, receive a short induction about where to park safely, and wear the required PPE (boots, vest, helmet). He is not allowed to walk freely into the main building."

They check if you are driving safely (wearing a seatbelt, not speeding). On site, they check if *people* are safe (wearing PPE, using ladders correctly). They focus on the **process** of working.\n*   **Building Control:** Think of them as the **Vehicle Inspector (MOT)**. They check if the car itself is built correctly (brakes work, emissions are low). On site, they check if the *building* is safe (fire exits, structural walls, ventilation). They focus on the **final product**.\n\n**Utility Inspectors (Water & Electrical)**\nThese are specialized inspectors for specific services:\n*   **Water Inspectors:** Check plumbing to prevent contamination of the public water supply.\n*   **Electrical Inspectors:** Check wiring to prevent fire and shock.\n\n**Statutory Inspections**\nA **Statutory Inspection** is a check required by law. You cannot choose to skip it. For example, you *must* have the wiring inspected before the power is turned on. Passing these inspections proves **Compliance**."
