        "title": "The Role of Site Visitors",
        "content": "### Who visits the site?\nApart from the regular construction team (managers and tradespeople), other people will visit the site. These **External Visitors** usually fall into two categories:\n\n1.  **Commercial Visitors:** Clients, architects, or suppliers. They care about the schedule, the cost, and the look of the project.\n2.  **Statutory Inspectors:** Officials with legal powers. They care about the law and safety.\n\n**The Driving Test Analogy**\nThink of a construction site like a driving test. \n*   The **Worker** is the driver.\n*   The **Site Manager** is the driving instructor (helping you pass).\n*   The **Statutory Inspector** is the Examiner. They don't help you drive; they just check if you are following the rules (Compliance). If you break a serious rule, they can stop the test immediately.\n\n**What is Compliance?**\n**Compliance** means meeting the mandatory legal standards. A Statutory Inspector visits to verify compliance. They are not there to be helpful or give advice on how to build; they are there to confirm the work is legal. \n\n**Key Rules for All Visitors**\nRegardless of who they are (Client or Inspector), every visitor must:\n*   **Report to the Site Office:** This is the first step. The Site Management team must know exactly who is on site for safety reasons (e.g., in case of a fire roll call).\n*   **Sign In:** Record their arrival in the site log.\n*   **Wear PPE:** Follow the site's safety rules (helmets, boots, vests).\n\n**Powers of a Statutory Inspector**\nWhile a client can complain about the paint color, a **Statutory Inspector** has the power to enter the site by law. If they find dangerous non-compliance, they can issue notices to stop the work. You cannot refuse them entry if they have a legal warrant or reason.\n\n**Micro-scenario**\n*Imagine you are wiring a house. The homeowner visits to see where the sockets are (Commercial Visitor). Later, a Building Control Officer visits to test if the wiring is safe (Statutory Inspector). You treat both with respect, but the Officer has the legal power to make you redo the work if it is unsafe.*"

        "content": "### Knowing Who to Call\nDifferent inspectors cover different parts of the job. Mixing them up can cause delays. We will look at the three most common ones: **HSE**, **Building Control**, and the **DNO**.\n\n**1. Health and Safety Executive (HSE)**\n*   **Focus:** The *Safety of People*. \n*   **What they check:** Are workers wearing PPE? Is the scaffolding safe? Is there dust control?\n*   **Power:** They can issue a **Prohibition Notice** to stop work immediately if there is a risk of serious injury.\n*   **Analogy:** The \"Traffic Police\" of the site. They stop you if you are driving dangerously.\n\n**2. Building Control Officer (BCO)**\n*   **Focus:** The *Quality of the Building*.\n*   **What they check:** Is the foundation deep enough? Is the insulation correct? Does the structure meet Building Regulations?\n*   **Power:** They can refuse to sign off the project, meaning the building cannot be sold or used.\n*   **Analogy:** The \"Vehicle Inspector\" (MOT). They check if the car itself is built correctly.\n\n**3. Distribution Network Operator (DNO)**\n*   **Focus:** The *Supply Connection*.\n*   **What they check:** The physical cables, pipes, and transformers that bring electricity/gas to the site boundary.\n*   **Note:** The DNO owns the infrastructure. The \"Energy Supplier\" (who sends the bill) just sells the energy. You call the DNO for a new connection or if a main supply cable is damaged.\n\n**Comparison Table**\n| Official | Focus | Example Check |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **HSE** | Safety of Workers | \"Is that ladder tied down?\" |\n| **Building Control** | Quality of Structure | \"Is that wall fire-rated?\" |\n| **DNO** | Infrastructure | \"Where should we put the main fuse?\" |\n\n**Micro-scenario: The Trench**\n*   If you dig a trench, the **HSE** checks if it is shored up so it doesn't collapse on you.\n*   The **Building Control Officer** checks if the trench is in the right place for the foundation.\n*   The **DNO** comes to lay the main power cable inside the trench.*"
