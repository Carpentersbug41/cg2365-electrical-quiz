        "title": "The Rig-Safe Mindset",
        "content": "Dead testing is the foundation of electrical safety and verification. In a training environment, **dead testing** refers to work carried out on a rig that is physically isolated, proven dead, and maintained in a controlled state. This means the supply cable is disconnected or the main isolator is locked in the &apos;OFF&apos; position.\n\n### 1. The Minimum Safe Conditions\nBefore any test leads touch a terminal, you must ensure the rig is in a **safe state**. This is not an assumption; it is a confirmed condition. On a training rig, this involves:\n1. Physically disconnecting the rig from the mains supply.\n2. Ensuring the main switch and all MCBs are in the &apos;OFF&apos; position unless the specific test requires them to be &apos;ON&apos; (e.g., for circuit path continuity).\n3. Verifying the area is clear of other students who might inadvertently re-energise the equipment.\n\n### 2. The &quot;Before You Test&quot; Routine\nConsistency is the enemy of error. A repeatable routine prevents missed steps and unreliable data. Always follow these steps:\n- **Prepare:** Clear the workspace and identify the specific circuit to be tested.\n- **Identify:** Locate the exact terminals (L, N, CPC) for the test.\n- **Select:** Choose the correct instrument (e.g., a Multi-Function Tester or a dedicated Continuity Tester).\n- **Check Leads:** Inspect leads for damage and ensure they are plugged into the correct ports on the meter.\n- **Null/Zero:** Short the lead tips together and use the &apos;Null&apos; function to remove the resistance of the leads from your readings.\n\n### 3. Selecting the Correct Instrument\nUsing the wrong tool leads to &quot;false passes&quot; or damaged equipment. \n- **Continuity (Low Ohms):** Used for checking conductors. It uses a low voltage and small current to measure very low resistance (typically 0.01Ω to 20Ω).\n- **Insulation Resistance (High Ohms/MΩ):** Used for checking the quality of insulation. It applies a high voltage (typically 250V or 500V) to see if current &quot;leaks&quot; across the insulation. \n\n### 4. The Danger of Rushing\nRushing setup causes **unsafe assumptions**. If you skip nulling, your readings will be higher than they actually are, potentially failing a perfectly good circuit. If you use a continuity &apos;buzzer&apos; instead of reading the actual Ohms, you might miss a high-resistance joint that could cause a fire later. Reliable results require a calm, methodical approach."
