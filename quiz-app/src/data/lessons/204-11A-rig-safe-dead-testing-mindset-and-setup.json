        "content": "Dead testing is the foundation of electrical verification. In a training environment, **dead testing** means carrying out checks on a rig that is in its **approved dead state**: isolated from supply, confirmed dead by the training setup, and kept controlled (as directed by tutor/rig procedure).\n\n### 1. The Minimum Safe Conditions\nBefore any test leads touch a terminal, you must confirm the rig is in a **safe state**. This is not a guess; it is a confirmed condition. On a training rig, this involves:\n1. Confirming the rig is in the approved dead state (isolated and secured in line with the rig procedure).\n2. Confirming you are working on the correct circuit and the correct terminals for the task.\n3. Keeping the work area controlled so the rig cannot be changed by someone else during testing.\n\n### 2. The &quot;Before You Test&quot; Routine\nConsistency reduces error. A repeatable routine prevents missed steps and unreliable results. Use the same setup steps every time:\n- **Prepare:** Clear the workspace and identify the exact circuit to be tested.\n- **Identify:** Locate the correct terminals (L, N, CPC) for the test you are about to perform.\n- **Select:** Choose the correct instrument and function (e.g., continuity/low-ohms vs insulation resistance).\n- **Check Leads:** Inspect leads for damage and confirm they are plugged into the correct ports on the meter.\n- **Null/Zero (where required):** Some low-ohms continuity work may require nulling/zeroing. At this stage, the key point is to recognise when it is needed; you will practise the technique and its impact later.\n\n### 3. Selecting the Correct Instrument\nUsing the wrong tool can produce misleading results or damage equipment.\n- **Continuity / Low-ohms:** Used to check intended paths along conductors (e.g., CPC continuity). You are looking for a stable low resistance reading.\n- **Insulation Resistance (IR):** Used to check separation between conductors (e.g., L–N, L–CPC, N–CPC). You are looking for a very high resistance reading.\n\n### 4. The Danger of Rushing\nRushing setup creates unsafe assumptions and unreliable data.\n- If you skip the approved-dead-state confirmation, you are not working under the rig&apos;s safe condition.\n- If you use the wrong function or the leads are in the wrong ports, results can look &quot;fine&quot; when they are not.\n- If you rely on a quick beep without checking stability and recording a value, you can miss signs that your setup is poor (loose probes, wrong points, inconsistent contact).\n\nReliable results come from a calm, methodical setup routine."
