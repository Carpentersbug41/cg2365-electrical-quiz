        "title": "Navigating Technical Information",
        "content": "In the electrical industry, you never guess. Every decision is backed by **technical information**. This information comes from several key sources that you must be able to navigate: \n\n1. **Specifications**: These tell you exactly what materials and equipment to buy. If the spec says '600x600 LED panels', you cannot install cheaper alternatives without permission. \n\n2. **Drawings**: These show the layout and positioning. They tell you where the sockets, lights, and consumer units go. \n\n3. **BS 7671 (The Regs)**: The 'big blue book' contains the mandatory safety rules for all UK electrical installations. \n\n4. **On-Site Guide (OSG)**: A simplified version of BS 7671 for common installations, providing quick tables for cable sizing and fuse selection. \n\n5. **Manufacturer’s Data**: This is critical for specific items like extractor fans or smart dimmers. It tells you the maximum torque for terminals and the IP rating. \n\n**Drawing Types and Symbols** \n\nYou will encounter different drawings depending on the task. **Block diagrams** show the 'big picture' using boxes to represent sections (like Mains -> Sub-main -> Distribution Board). **Schematics** focus on the logic of connections, while **Wiring Diagrams** show actual terminal-to-terminal connections. Once a job is finished, an **As-Fitted Drawing** is produced to show the final, real-world arrangement. \n\nTo read these drawings, you must use the **Legend**. Symbols are standard: \n- **Switches**: A circle with one line (1-way), two lines (2-way), or a cross (intermediate). \n- **Socket Outlets**: A semi-circle. A single line through it usually means unswitched; two lines mean a twin socket. \n- **Consumer Unit**: A rectangle with a diagonal line through it. \n\n**Understanding Scale** \n\nScale is a ratio that allows large buildings to fit on small pieces of paper. A common scale is **1:50**. This means that 1mm on the paper represents 50mm in the real world. To find a real distance: \n1. Measure the distance on the drawing with a ruler (in mm). \n2. Multiply that measurement by the scale factor (e.g., 50). \n3. Convert the final answer to metres (divide by 1000) for practical use on-site."
