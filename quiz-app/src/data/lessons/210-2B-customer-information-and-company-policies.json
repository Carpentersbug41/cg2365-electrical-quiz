        "content": "### In this lesson\n\nWe will learn how to choose the right document when talking about money with a customer, and what rights the customer has. This covers **AC3** (Customer Information).\n\n**What this is**\n\nWhen you discuss costs with a customer, you must be clear about whether the price is fixed or flexible.\n\n1.  **Estimate:** Use this when you are **not sure** how much work is needed. \n    *   *Example:* You are asked to fix a leak under a floor. You don't know if it's a loose pipe or a cracked joint until you lift the floorboards. You give an **Estimate** of £150–£200. If the job is harder than expected, the price can go up.\n\n2.  **Quotation:** Use this when you know **exactly** what is needed. \n    *   *Example:* You are installing a specific shower unit. You know the cost of the unit and how long it takes. You give a **Quotation** of £450. Even if it takes you longer than expected, you cannot charge more than £450.\n\n3.  **Invoice:** This is sent **after** the job is done. It says, \"The work is finished, please pay this amount.\"\n\n**Statutory Cancellation Rights**\n\nCustomers often have a legal right to change their mind. If a customer signs a contract **at their home** (away from your business premises), the law usually gives them a **cooling-off period** (often 14 days). During this time, they can cancel the work without penalty. You must inform them of this right in writing.\n\n**Handover Information**\n\nWhen the job is done, you must give the customer the information they need to use the system safely. This includes user manuals, safety certificates, and maintenance advice.\n\n**Why it matters**\n\nIf you give a **Quotation** when you should have given an **Estimate**, you might lose money if the job becomes difficult. If you fail to tell a customer about their **Cancellation Rights**, the contract might not be valid, and they might not have to pay you.\n\n**Key Facts**\n\n*   **Estimate** = Approximate price (can change).\n*   **Quotation** = Fixed price (binding promise).\n*   **Invoice** = Bill for payment (after work).\n*   **Cancellation Rights** apply mainly to contracts signed **away from business premises** (e.g., at the customer's home)."

        "content": "### In this lesson\n\nWe will look at the internal rules that govern how you behave at work. This covers **AC4** (Company Policies).\n\n**What this is**\n\nEvery company has a **Company Policy**. These are the \"house rules\" for employees. They usually cover:\n\n*   **Dress Code:** Wearing the correct uniform and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). This identifies you to the customer and keeps you safe.\n*   **Timekeeping:** Arriving on time. Lateness delays the whole project and upsets customers.\n*   **Behavior:** Being polite and professional. You represent the company's brand.\n\n**Limits of Authority**\n\nEven if you are good at your job, you don't have the power to decide everything. **Limits of Authority** define what you can and cannot do. \n\n*   **Scenario:** You are an apprentice. A supplier arrives with a £5,000 delivery. \n    *   *Can you sign the delivery note?* Usually, yes, to say \"it arrived\".\n    *   *Can you order £5,000 of new parts?* No. You do not have the **authority** to spend the company's money.\n\nThese limits are often written in your **Contract of Employment**. They protect you from making expensive mistakes and protect the company from unauthorized spending.\n\n**Why it matters**\n\nIf you break **Company Policy** (e.g., by being rude or late), the company loses its reputation and you might face disciplinary action. If you exceed your **Limits of Authority** (e.g., promising a customer a discount you aren't allowed to give), the company might be forced to honor a deal that loses them money.\n\n**Key Facts**\n\n*   **Company Policy** sets standards for behavior, dress, and timekeeping.\n*   **Limits of Authority** prevent junior staff from making high-risk financial or legal decisions.\n*   Apprentices generally have very narrow limits of authority and must seek supervision for major decisions."
