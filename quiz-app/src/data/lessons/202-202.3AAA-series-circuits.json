        "title": "The Fundamentals of Series Circuits",
        "content": "A **series circuit** is the simplest form of electrical connection. In this configuration, all components are connected one after another, forming a **single path** for the electrons to follow. If you think of electricity like water flowing through a pipe, a series circuit is like a single pipe with several valves installed in a line; if any valve is closed (or the pipe breaks), the water stops flowing everywhere. \n\nThere are three critical rules that every electrician must master regarding series circuits: \n\n1. **Current (I) is the same everywhere**: Because there is only one path, the number of electrons passing through the first resistor must be the same as the number passing through the last. If you measure 2 Amps at the start of the circuit, you will measure 2 Amps at the end. \n\n2. **Total Resistance (RT) is the sum of all resistors**: Every component added in series adds more &quot;friction&quot; or opposition to the flow. To find the total resistance, simply add the values together: **RT = R1 + R2 + R3...** Adding more resistors always increases the total resistance and, if the voltage stays the same, decreases the total current. \n\n3. **Voltage (V) is shared**: The total voltage provided by the source is &quot;dropped&quot; across each component. The sum of these individual voltage drops must equal the supply voltage (**VT = V1 + V2 + V3...**). A larger resistor will always take a larger share of the voltage. \n\n**Calculations and Ohm&apos;s Law** \nTo solve a series circuit, you usually follow a set sequence. First, calculate the **Total Resistance (RT)**. Second, use the supply voltage and RT to find the **Total Current (IT)** using the formula **I = V / R**. Once you have the current, you can find the specific voltage drop across any individual resistor by multiplying that current by that specific resistance (e.g., **V1 = I x R1**). \n\n**Fault Behavior** \nIn a series circuit, faults have a global impact. An **open circuit** (like a blown bulb or a loose wire) creates an infinite resistance path, meaning the current drops to **0 Amps** throughout the entire loop. Conversely, a **short circuit** across one component removes its resistance from the loop. This causes the total resistance to drop, which forces the current to increase, potentially leading to overheating or blown fuses."
