Different designers and CAD libraries can use different shapes. **Always check the legend on that specific drawing set** to confirm symbol meaning.\n\n## How to use the drawing (simple method)\n1. Identify the drawing type (layout plan or schematic).\n2. Find the **legend/key** and confirm what the symbol means.\n3. Read **general notes** and any abbreviations next to the symbol (e.g., AFFL, IP rating, TBC).\n4. Check the **title block** for scale or **NTS**.\n\n## Common mistakes to avoid\n- **Guessing from shape:** assuming a circle is a light when the legend says it is a detector.\n- **Measuring an NTS drawing:** using a ruler on a drawing marked \"Not to Scale\".\n\n## Quick recap\n- **Plan = where**.\n- **Schematic = how**.\n- **Legend is the authority** for symbol meanings on that job."

Families help you scan a plan quickly, but you still confirm details using the legend and notes.\n\n## What this is\nSymbols represent the physical accessories you install. Common families include:\n- **Switches** (1-way, 2-way, intermediate, pull-cord)\n- **Sockets** (single/twin, switched/unswitched)\n- **Lighting** (ceiling points, wall lights, emergency lights)\n- **Fixed equipment** (FCUs, CCUs, isolators)\n\n## Why it matters\nNotes and abbreviations can change **what you install** and **how you install it**. Example: a socket point with an IP rating requirement means you must select a suitable product for that environment.\n\n## Key abbreviations you must know\n- **AFFL** (Above Finished Floor Level): tells you mounting height (e.g., 1200 mm AFFL).\n- **NTS** (Not to scale): you cannot measure distances from the drawing.\n- **IP rating** (e.g., IP44/IP65): tells you the required protection against dust and water.\n- **FCU** (Fused Connection Unit): typically for fixed appliances.\n- **CCU** (Cooker Control Unit): heavy-duty cooker switch/control point.\n\n## How to use symbols + notes together (the safe method)\n1. Find the symbol on the plan.\n2. Use the **legend** to identify what the symbol represents.\n3. Read **general notes** for rules that apply to the whole drawing (common heights, standard equipment, special instructions).\n4. Read **abbreviations next to the point** (AFFL/IP/TBC etc.) to apply point-specific requirements.\n\n## Common mistakes\n- **Ignoring AFFL:** fitting the right item at the wrong height.\n- **Ignoring IP:** fitting a standard accessory where a higher protection rating is required.\n- **Guessing symbol variations:** some drawings use small marks to distinguish types, but **the legend is still the authority**.\n\n## Quick recap\n- Families help you scan.\n- Legend tells you **what it is**.\n- Notes + abbreviations tell you **constraints** (height, rating, special instructions)."
