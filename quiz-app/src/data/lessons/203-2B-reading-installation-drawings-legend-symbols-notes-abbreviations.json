        "content": "**What this is**\nElectrical drawings are the primary language of the construction site. They come in different formats depending on what information they need to convey. A **Layout Plan** shows you exactly where a socket or light goes in a room. A **Schematic or Circuit Diagram** shows you how the wires connect logically between components, ignoring the physical walls of the building.\n\n**Why it matters**\nIf you try to wire a circuit using only a layout plan, you won't know the logical sequence of the points. Conversely, if you use only a schematic, you won't know which wall to chase the cables into. Most importantly, symbols are not always universal; a circle might mean a light on one drawing but a junction box on another. This is why the **Legend (Key)** is the absolute authority on any job.\n\n**Key rules / facts**\n*   **Layout Plan = Where:** Shows physical location in the building.\n*   **Schematic = How:** Shows logical electrical connections.\n*   **Legend-First Rule:** Always check the legend before interpreting symbols. Never guess based on shape.\n*   **The Legend is Law:** If the legend says a square is a socket, then for that job, it is a socket, regardless of what you saw on a previous job.\n\n**How to use it**\n1.  Identify the drawing type (Plan or Schematic).\n2.  Locate the **Legend** (usually in the bottom corner or on page one).\n3.  Match the symbol on the plan to the definition in the legend.\n4.  Read the **General Notes** for site-wide requirements.\n\n**Common mistakes**\n*   **Guessing symbol meaning:** Assuming a symbol means '1-way switch' when the legend defines it as 'intermediate'.\n*   **Measuring NTS drawings:** Using a scale ruler on a drawing marked 'Not To Scale' (NTS).\n\n**Quick recap**\n*   Plans show physical location; schematics show logical connections.\n*   The legend is the only authoritative source for symbol meanings.\n*   Always read the notes before starting work."

        "content": "**What this is**\nSymbols are grouped into 'families' that share similar visual traits. Recognizing these families helps you navigate a drawing quickly. Abbreviations provide the 'fine print' that symbols cannot show.\n\n**Why it matters**\nMisidentifying a symbol family leads to incorrect material orders. For example, installing a standard socket where a Fused Connection Unit (FCU) was required is a costly error. Abbreviations like **IP65** or **AFFL** tell you exactly which version of a component to buy and how high to mount it.\n\n**Key rules / facts**\n*   **Switch Family:** Usually circles or lines with 'tails'. Includes 1-way, 2-way, intermediate, and pull-cords.\n*   **Socket Family:** Usually semi-circles or squares with lines indicating the number of 'gangs' (single or twin).\n*   **FCU (Fused Connection Unit):** Often shown as a square with a specific internal mark (like an 'F' or a fuse symbol).\n*   **Lighting Family:** Crosses (ceiling points), circles with lines (wall lights), or rectangles (fluorescent/LED).\n*   **Abbreviations:**\n    *   **IP Rating (e.g., IP44):** Defines protection against water/dust.\n    *   **AFFL:** Above Finished Floor Level (mounting height).\n    *   **CU / DB:** Consumer Unit or Distribution Board.\n    *   **TBC:** To Be Confirmed (stop and ask before installing).\n\n**How to use it**\n1.  Identify the base symbol shape (e.g., a semi-circle for a socket).\n2.  Check for modifiers (e.g., a 'S' might mean switched).\n3.  Look for nearby abbreviations (e.g., 'AFFL 450' means mount at 450mm height).\n4.  Cross-reference with the legend to be 100% certain.\n\n**Common mistakes**\n*   **Ignoring IP ratings:** Installing a standard light in a bathroom when the note specified IP65.\n*   **Confusing FCUs and Sockets:** They can look similar on crowded plans; always check the internal symbol letters.\n\n**Quick recap**\n*   Symbols are grouped into families (Switches, Sockets, Lights, FCUs).\n*   Abbreviations like AFFL and IP ratings provide essential installation details.\n*   FCU stands for Fused Connection Unit."
