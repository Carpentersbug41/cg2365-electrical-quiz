        "content": "Before you pick up a tool, you must understand the type of drawing in front of you. Electrical drawings aren't just pictures; they are legal instructions. \n\n**What this is**\nIn the electrical industry, we primarily use two types of drawings: the **Layout Plan** and the **Schematic (Circuit) Diagram**. A Layout Plan is a bird's-eye view of a room showing exactly **where** a socket or light goes. A Schematic shows **how** the electricity flows logically between components, ignoring their physical room position.\n\n**Why it matters**\nIf you confuse a schematic for a layout, you might install a consumer unit in the middle of a living room wall just because it looked like that on the diagram. Real-world installation requires the layout plan to find the position and the schematic to understand the wiring logic.\n\n**Key rules / facts**\n*   **The Legend-First Rule:** Symbols are not universal. Different CAD (Computer-Aided Design) programs and different designers use different shapes. You must **always** check the Legend (or Key) on that specific drawing before interpreting symbols. The Legend is the final authority.\n*   **Plan = Where:** Floor plans show physical locations.\n*   **Schematic = How:** Diagrams show logical connections.\n\n**How to use it**\n1. Identify the drawing type (Plan or Schematic).\n2. Locate the Legend/Key (usually in the bottom corner).\n3. Match the symbol on the drawing to the definition in the Legend.\n4. Read the Title Block to check the scale or if it is marked **NTS (Not to Scale)**.\n\n**Common mistakes**\n*   **Guessing from shape:** Assuming a circle is a light when the legend says it is a smoke detector.\n*   **Measuring an NTS drawing:** Trying to use a ruler on a drawing marked &quot;Not to Scale&quot;.\n\n**Quick recap**\n*   Layout plans show physical location (where).\n*   Schematics show logical connection (how).\n*   The Legend is the only authority for symbol meanings on a specific job."

        "content": "Once you have checked the Legend, you will notice symbols fall into 'families'. Understanding these families helps you navigate plans faster.\n\n**What this is**\nSymbols represent the physical accessories you install. They are often grouped by function: **Switches**, **Sockets**, **Lighting**, and **Fixed Equipment** (like Cooker Units).\n\n**Why it matters**\nAbbreviations and notes change the physical item you buy. A 'socket' symbol with the note **IP66** means you must install a weatherproof socket, not a standard white plastic one. Ignoring these details leads to safety failures and failed inspections.\n\n**Key rules / facts**\n*   **Switch Family:** Includes 1-way, 2-way, intermediate, and pull-cords. Look for 'tails' or 'dots' on symbols to distinguish them.\n*   **Socket Family:** Single or twin, switched or unswitched. The Legend will specify if a line through the symbol means 'switched'.\n*   **FCU (Fused Connection Unit):** Often used for fixed appliances like hand dryers or boilers.\n*   **CCU (Cooker Control Unit):** A heavy-duty switch for cookers.\n*   **CU / DB:** Labels for the Consumer Unit or Distribution Board.\n*   **AFFL (Above Finished Floor Level):** This note tells you the mounting height (e.g., 450mm AFFL).\n*   **IP Rating (e.g., IP44/IP65):** Defines the degree of protection against dust and water.\n\n**How to use it**\n1. Locate a symbol on the floor plan.\n2. Cross-reference the symbol in the **Legend** to identify the family (e.g., Twin Switched Socket).\n3. Check the **General Notes** for mounting heights (AFFL).\n4. Look for specific **Abbreviations** next to the symbol (e.g., IP65) to determine the equipment's environmental rating.\n\n**Common mistakes**\n*   **Ignoring AFFL:** Installing all sockets at 450mm when the notes specified 1200mm for a kitchen worktop.\n*   **Mixing up FCU and CCU:** These serve very different power loads.\n\n**Quick recap**\n*   Identify symbols by family (Switches, Sockets, etc.).\n*   AFFL specifies the mounting height.\n*   IP ratings specify environmental protection requirements."
