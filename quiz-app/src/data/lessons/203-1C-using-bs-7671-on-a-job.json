        "content": "In the UK, the **Electricity at Work Regulations (EAWR)** is the law (statutory). However, the EAWR is written in broad terms, stating that we must &quot;prevent danger.&quot; It does not tell you exactly how many millimetres of insulation you need or what size fuse to use. This is where **BS 7671 (The IET Wiring Regulations)** comes in.\n\nBS 7671 is a **non-statutory** document, but it is the recognized technical standard for electrical installations. In a court of law or during a health and safety inspection, following BS 7671 is considered **&quot;deemed to comply&quot;** with the law. This means that if you follow the regulations correctly, you have strong evidence that you acted safely and used best practice. \n\nFor an electrician on a real job, BS 7671 provides the technical rules for:\n1. **Protection against electric shock** (how quickly a circuit must trip).\n2. **Selection of equipment** (choosing the right breakers and cables).\n3. **Installation methods** (how to fix and support wiring).\n\nEssentially, BS 7671 is your professional shield. It protects the user by ensuring a safe installation, and it protects the electrician by providing a documented path to legal compliance. If you ever have to defend your work, your first line of defense is showing that you followed the relevant Regulation numbers."

Instead, you must master the **lookup workflow**. Use the **Index** at the back or the **Contents** at the front to find keywords. \n\nWhen you make a decision on site—such as choosing a specific RCD—you should record the **Regulation number** in your notes or on the certificate. This is called &quot;citing&quot; a regulation. It shows **due diligence**, proving that your decision wasn't a guess, but was based on the official technical standard. \n\nA good site note looks like this: &quot;Additional protection provided by 30mA RCD as per Reg 411.3.3.&quot; This simple habit makes your work professional and legally robust."

It provides ready-made tables for cable sizes and circuit lengths. **Use this first** for standard jobs to see if your plan fits within common limits.\n\n2. **BS 7671 (The 'Big Blue/Brown Book')**: This is the master document. If a job is complex, unusual, or outside the scope of the OSG, you must use BS 7671. It contains the actual legal-technical requirements that apply to every installation.\n\n3. **Guidance Notes (GN)**: There are several Guidance Notes (e.g., GN3 for Inspection and Testing). These provide a deeper **interpretation** of the regulations. If you understand the rule but aren't sure *how* to apply it or *why* it exists, the Guidance Notes explain it in detail.\n\n**The Workflow:**\n- Need a quick cable size for a house? -> **OSG**\n- Need the exact wording of a regulation? -> **BS 7671**\n- Need to know how to perform a specific test? -> **Guidance Note 3**\n\nAlways remember: The OSG is a shortcut.
