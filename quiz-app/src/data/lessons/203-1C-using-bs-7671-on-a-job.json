It does not tell you the exact technical rules for every installation decision.\n\nBS 7671 (the IET Wiring Regulations) is non-statutory (not a law), but it is the recognised technical standard for electrical installations. In practice, applying BS 7671 correctly is widely accepted as strong evidence that you have taken reasonable precautions and worked safely.\n\nFor a real job, BS 7671 provides the technical rules for things like:\n- Protection against electric shock (e.g., disconnection times and additional protection)\n- Selection of equipment (e.g., choosing suitable protective devices and cables)\n- Installation methods (e.g., support, mechanical protection, and routing)\n\nKey idea:\n- EAWR tells you your legal duty (prevent danger)\n- BS 7671 tells you a recognised technical way to meet that duty\n\nSo, BS 7671 protects the user by improving safety, and it protects the electrician by providing a clear, defendable technical basis for decisions."

It shows your decision came from a recognised standard, not guesswork.\n\nExample site note format:\n- Decision: 30 mA RCD additional protection provided to socket-outlets.\n- Evidence: BS 7671 Reg 411.3.3 cited in job notes.\n\n(You will not be judged on memorising 411.3.3.
