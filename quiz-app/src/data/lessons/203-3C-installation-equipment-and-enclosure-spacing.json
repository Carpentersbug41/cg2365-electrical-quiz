Because different materials have different properties, we use specific tools to ensure the containment remains strong and smooth.\n\n**1. Metallic Systems (Steel Conduit)**\nSteel conduit is rigid and requires mechanical joints. We use a **Stock and Die** to cut threads onto the ends of the pipe. \n*   **Anchor:** If you didn't cut these threads, you couldn't screw the pipe into a junction box, leaving the cables exposed to sharp edges.\n\n**2. Non-Metallic Systems (PVC Conduit)**\nPVC is flexible when bent, but it wants to 'kink' or collapse. A **Bending Spring** is inserted into the pipe before bending.\n*   **Anchor:** The spring provides internal pressure, keeping the pipe round so that cables can actually fit through the corner later.\n\n**3. The Installation Phase**\nOnce the pipes are fixed to the walls, we use a **Draw Tape** (or 'fish tape'). This is a long, flexible strip of steel or nylon pushed through the empty conduit.\n*   **Micro-Scenario:** You push the tape through a 10-meter run, hook the cables to the end, and pull them back through the pipe. Without this, you could never get a flexible wire through a long, rigid pipe.\n\n**Key Rule:** Tools must match the material. You cannot use a Bending Spring on steel, and a Stock and Die is only for metallic systems."

This means 55% of the inside must be empty air. This air allows heat to escape from the cables.\n\n**The Factor System (Conduit)**\nFor conduit (round pipes), calculating area is harder because of bends. Instead of percentages, we use a 'Factor' system from BS 7671 (the IET Wiring Regulations):\n1.  **Cable Factor:** A number for each wire (e.g., a 2.5mm² wire might have a factor of 30).\n2.  **Enclosure Factor:** A number for the pipe (e.g., a 20mm conduit with two bends might have a capacity factor of 460).\n\n**The Golden Rule:**\nSum of all Cable Factors ≤ Enclosure Factor.\n\n**Micro-Scenario:**\nIf your total Cable Factor is 500, but your conduit only allows 460, the cables will be packed too tightly. You must either use a larger pipe or a different route with fewer bends."
