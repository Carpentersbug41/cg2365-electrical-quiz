        "content": "Health and safety legislation exists to **protect people** from harm in the workplace. Without these laws, there would be no legal requirement for employers to provide safe working conditions.\n\n**The Core Purpose:**\n- **Prevent accidents, injuries, and deaths** in the workplace\n- **Establish clear responsibilities** for employers and employees\n- **Set minimum safety standards** that everyone must follow\n- **Provide legal enforcement** to ensure compliance\n- **Create a culture of safety** across all industries\n\n**The Electrical Context:**\nElectricity is particularly dangerous because:\n- It can cause **fatal electric shocks** even at relatively low voltages\n- It can cause **severe burns** from arc faults and short circuits\n- It can cause **fires** if electrical systems are not properly maintained\n- Risks are often **invisible** — you cannot see electricity\n\nThat's why specific regulations exist for electrical work, in addition to general workplace safety laws.\n\n**Key Principle:**\nHealth and safety regulations are **not optional** — they are **legal requirements**. Breaking them can result in prosecution, fines, or even imprisonment for serious breaches."

It applies to **all workplaces** and **all work activities**.\n\n**What You Need to Know (Not the Full Legal Text):**\n\nThe HASAWA establishes the **fundamental principle**: Employers and employees both have legal duties to ensure safety.\n\n**The Act requires:**\n1. **Safe systems of work** must be provided\n2. **Safe equipment and machinery** must be used\n3. **Information, instruction, training, and supervision** must be provided\n4. **Safe working environment** must be maintained\n5. **Welfare facilities** must be provided (toilets, washing, rest areas)\n\n**Important Concept: \"So Far As Is Reasonably Practicable\"**\nThe Act uses this phrase throughout. It means you must do everything reasonable to ensure safety, **unless** the cost or effort is grossly disproportionate to the risk.\n\n**Example:**\n- Installing guardrails around an open hole is **reasonably practicable** ✓\n- Building a £10 million safety system to prevent a minor scratch is **not reasonably practicable** ✗\n\n**Key Point for Exams:**\nYou don't need to memorize the full legal text. You need to understand **who is responsible for what**, and **why** the regulations exist."

They work **alongside** the Health and Safety at Work Act.\n\n**What You Need to Know:**\n\nThe EAWR set out requirements for **all electrical systems, equipment, and work activities** involving electricity.\n\n**Key Requirements:**\n\n**1. Construction and Maintenance (Regulation 4)**\n- All electrical systems must be constructed and maintained to prevent danger\n- Systems must be suitable for their use and environment\n- Regular maintenance and inspection are required\n\n**2. Work on or Near Live Conductors (Regulation 14)**\n- **Work on live conductors should be avoided wherever possible**\n- Live working is only permitted if it is **unreasonable** to make the system dead\n- If live working is necessary, **precautions must be taken** (e.g., insulated tools, barriers)\n\n**3. Competence (Regulation 16)**\n- **No person shall work on electrical systems unless they are competent** to do so\n- Competence means adequate **training, knowledge, experience, and supervision**\n\n**4. Isolation and Switching (Regulation 12-13)**\n- Means of isolation must be provided for every circuit\n- Systems must be properly isolated before work begins\n- Clear procedures for **safe isolation** must be followed\n\n**Why These Regulations Matter:**\n- Electricity can kill — even 230V mains can be fatal\n- Electrical faults cause thousands of fires every year\n- Only competent people should work with electricity\n- Following the regulations **protects you and others**\n\n**Key Point for Exams:**\nFocus on **what** the regulations require (safe systems, competent people, avoid live working) and **why** (to prevent death, injury, and fire)."

Both employers and employees have **legal duties** under the regulations.\n\n---\n\n## Employer Responsibilities\n\n**Under the Health and Safety at Work Act, employers MUST:**\n\n1. **Provide a safe workplace**\n   - Safe premises, equipment, and systems of work\n   - Safe access and egress (ways in and out)\n\n2. **Provide information, instruction, and training**\n   - Employees must know how to work safely\n   - Training must be appropriate for the tasks performed\n\n3. **Provide supervision**\n   - Especially for inexperienced or young workers\n\n4. **Conduct risk assessments**\n   - Identify hazards and implement control measures\n\n5. **Provide PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)**\n   - When risks cannot be controlled by other means\n   - Must be suitable, maintained, and employees trained in its use\n\n6. **Provide welfare facilities**\n   - Toilets, washing facilities, drinking water, rest areas\n\n7. **Have a written health and safety policy**\n   - If 5 or more employees\n\n8. **Consult with employees**\n   - On matters affecting their health and safety\n\n**Under the Electricity at Work Regulations, employers MUST also:**\n- Ensure electrical systems are safe and properly maintained\n- Ensure only **competent persons** work on electrical systems\n- Provide safe isolation procedures\n\n---\n\n## Employee Responsibilities\n\n**Under the Health and Safety at Work Act, employees MUST:**\n\n1. **Take reasonable care for their own safety**\n   - Follow safety procedures and instructions\n   - Use equipment properly\n\n2. **Take reasonable care for the safety of others**\n   - Your actions can affect colleagues and the public\n\n3. **Cooperate with the employer**\n   - On health and safety matters\n   - Follow training and instructions given\n\n4. **Not interfere with safety equipment**\n   - Do not misuse or damage safety equipment\n   - Do not remove guards or safety devices\n\n5. **Report hazards and defects**\n   - Tell your employer about unsafe conditions or equipment\n   - Report accidents and near-misses\n\n**Under the Electricity at Work Regulations, employees MUST also:**\n- Only perform electrical work if they are **competent** to do so\n- Follow safe isolation procedures\n- Use appropriate PPE and equipment\n\n---\n\n## Key Differences (Exam Focus)\n\n**Employers are responsible for:**\n- **Providing** safe systems, equipment, training, PPE, supervision\n- **Creating** policies and procedures\n- **Conducting** risk assessments\n\n**Employees are responsible for:**\n- **Following** the safe systems and procedures provided\n- **Using** equipment and PPE correctly\n- **Cooperating** with safety arrangements\n- **Reporting** problems\n\n**Remember:** Both have **legal duties**. An employer cannot blame an employee if they haven't provided proper training. An employee cannot ignore safety rules just because they find them inconvenient.\n\n**Shared Goal:** Everyone goes home safe at the end of the day."
