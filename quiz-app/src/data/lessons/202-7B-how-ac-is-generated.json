        "title": "Basic Components of an AC Generator",
        "content": "**What is a Generator?**\n\nAn AC generator (also called an **alternator**) converts **mechanical rotation** (from a turbine, engine, or wind) into **electrical energy**. It's the fundamental device that produces AC electricity in power stations.\n\n**The Four Essential Components:**\n\n**1. Rotating Loop (Armature)**\n- A loop or coil of wire that rotates\n- The conductor that \"cuts\" through the magnetic field\n- More turns = more voltage generated\n- In real generators, this is a coil with many turns on an iron core\n\n**2. Permanent Magnet (or Electromagnet)**\n- Creates a fixed magnetic field between North and South poles\n- The loop rotates within this field\n- In power stations, large electromagnets are used instead of permanent magnets\n\n**3. Slip Rings**\n- Two continuous metal rings attached to each end of the rotating loop\n- Rotate with the armature\n- Allow continuous electrical connection while spinning\n- Each ring connects to one end of the loop\n\n**4. Brushes**\n- Two fixed carbon contacts\n- Press lightly against the slip rings\n- Transfer the generated current from the rotating loop to the external circuit\n- One brush connects to each slip ring\n\n**Why These Components?**\n\n- The **loop** must rotate to cut the magnetic field (this generates the voltage)\n- The **magnet** provides the magnetic field to be cut\n- The **slip rings and brushes** solve a problem: how to get electricity out of something that's spinning without wires getting tangled\n\n**The Key Principle:**\n\nWhen a conductor (the loop) **moves through** a magnetic field, a voltage is **induced** in it. This is called **electromagnetic induction** (discovered by Michael Faraday in 1831). The faster the loop rotates, the more voltage is generated.\n\n**Real-World Examples:**\n- **Power stations**: Steam or water spins massive generators\n- **Car alternators**: Engine spins generator to charge battery\n- **Bicycle dynamos**: Wheel rotation powers lights\n- **Wind turbines**: Wind spins blades, which rotate generator"

        "title": "How Rotation Produces AC: The Sine Wave Explained",
        "content": "**The Basic Principle:**\n\nAs the loop rotates through the magnetic field, the **angle** at which it cuts the field continuously changes. This changing angle produces a voltage that smoothly varies up and down — creating a **sine wave**.\n\n**Following One Complete Rotation (0° to 360°):**\n\n**Position 1: 0° (Horizontal — Loop Parallel to Field)**\n- Loop is moving **parallel** to the field lines\n- Not cutting through any field lines\n- **Voltage = ZERO**\n- Sine wave: Starting point\n\n**Position 2: 90° (Vertical — Loop Perpendicular to Field)**\n- Loop is cutting through field lines at **maximum rate**\n- **Voltage = MAXIMUM POSITIVE**\n- Sine wave: Peak (top)\n- Current flows in one direction through the external circuit\n\n**Position 3: 180° (Horizontal — Loop Parallel to Field Again)**\n- Loop is again moving **parallel** to field lines\n- Not cutting through field lines\n- **Voltage = ZERO**\n- Sine wave: Crossing zero (middle)\n\n**Position 4: 270° (Vertical — Loop Perpendicular, Opposite Side)**\n- Loop cutting through field lines at **maximum rate** again\n- BUT now moving in the **opposite direction** through the field\n- **Voltage = MAXIMUM NEGATIVE**\n- Sine wave: Trough (bottom)\n- Current flows in **opposite direction** through external circuit\n\n**Position 5: 360° (Back to Start)**\n- Loop returns to original horizontal position\n- **Voltage = ZERO**\n- One complete **cycle** finished\n- Sine wave: Completed one full wave\n\n**Why It's a SINE Wave:**\n\nThe voltage follows a mathematical **sine** function because:\n- At 0° and 180°: The loop moves parallel (sin 0° = sin 180° = 0)\n- At 90°: Maximum cutting (sin 90° = +1)\n- At 270°: Maximum cutting, opposite direction (sin 270° = -1)\n\n**The Alternating Part:**\n\n- From 0° to 180°: Current flows in **one direction** (positive half-cycle)\n- From 180° to 360°: Current flows in the **opposite direction** (negative half-cycle)\n- This **reversal** is why it's called **Alternating Current**\n\n**Frequency and Speed:**\n\n- One complete rotation (360°) = One AC cycle\n- If the loop rotates **50 times per second** → Frequency = **50 Hz** (UK mains)\n- If it rotates **60 times per second** → Frequency = **60 Hz** (USA mains)\n\n**Key Insight:**\n\nThe **smooth continuous rotation** produces a **smooth continuous sine wave**. There are no sudden jumps — the voltage smoothly increases, decreases, reverses, and repeats. This is why AC from generators is naturally a sine wave."
