        "content": "A wiring system is the combination of the **cable type** and the **containment or support** used to install it. In the electrical industry, we don't just pick cables because they are cheap; we pick them based on the **environment** and the specific **external influences** they will face. \n\n**What this is**\nChoosing a wiring system involves matching the physical properties of the cable and its housing (like conduit or trunking) to the location where it will live. For example, a cable buried in a living room wall faces very different risks than a cable in a chemical factory or a cattle shed.\n\n**Why it matters**\nSelecting the wrong system leads to safety hazards. If you use standard PVC cable in a place where forklifts operate without protection, the cable will be crushed, causing a fire or electric shock. If you use a system that can't handle moisture in a dairy farm, corrosion will destroy the installation within months.\n\n**Key rules / facts**\n- **Domestic Environments:** Use flat **Twin & Earth (T&E)** cables hidden in walls or ceilings. This is neat and protected by the building structure.\n- **Commercial Environments:** Use **Trunking and Singles**. Shops and offices change layout often; trunking allows you to open the lid and add or remove circuits easily.\n- **Industrial Environments:** Use **Steel Conduit** or **Steel Wire Armoured (SWA)** cable. These provide high mechanical protection against impacts from tools and machinery.\n- **High Fire Risk / Life Safety:** Use **MICC** or fire-resistant cables. These must keep working during a fire to power emergency lights or fire alarms.\n- **Agricultural:** Use robust, corrosion-resistant systems like PVC conduit or SWA to handle moisture and animal waste (ammonia).\n\n**How to use it**\nWhen faced with a selection task, follow this workflow:\n1. Identify the environment (e.g., Workshop).\n2. Identify the main threat (e.g., Mechanical impact).\n3. Match the threat to a protection level (High impact = Steel containment).\n4. Select the system (e.g., Steel conduit + singles).\n\n**Common mistakes**\n- **Guessing:** Choosing a system based on what you have in the van rather than what the environment requires.\n- **Ignoring the Spec:** Every major job has a specification; failing to read it means you might install a system that doesn't meet the client's insurance requirements.\n- **Confusing Cable with System:** Remember, the 'system' includes the tray, trunking, or conduit, not just the wire.\n\n**Quick recap**\n- Domestic = Hidden/Neat (Twin & Earth).\n- Commercial = Flexible/Accessible (Trunking).\n- Industrial = Protected/Strong (Conduit/SWA)."
