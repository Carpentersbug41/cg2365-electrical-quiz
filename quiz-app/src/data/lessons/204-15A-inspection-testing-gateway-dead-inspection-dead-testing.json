        "title": "The Safe Isolation Sequence",
        "content": "### In this lesson\n- You will learn the systematic steps required to achieve a safe working environment on electrical systems.\n- This procedure is applied before any work begins to ensure conductors are de-energised and cannot be switched back on.\n- Key takeaways include the correct order of the JIB workflow, the role of physical locking, and the verification of dead circuits.\n\n**What this is**\n**Safe Isolation** is a formal, multi-step procedure used to disconnect and secure an electrical system. Unlike simple switching, which merely turns a device off, **Safe Isolation** involves physical security and verified testing. It ensures that the point of work is completely disconnected from the supply and that no unauthorized person can re-energise the circuit while work is in progress. It relies on a combination of mechanical locks and electrical verification using specialized tools.\n\n**Why it matters**\nElectricity is often invisible and silent. Without a rigorous sequence, a worker might assume a circuit is off when it is actually being fed from an alternative source or a mislabelled breaker. Furthermore, in a busy environment, another person might see a switch in the 'off' position and flip it back 'on' to restore power to their own area, unknowingly endangering the person working on that circuit. This sequence provides the evidence and security needed to work with confidence.\n\n**Key facts / rules**\n- Always identify the correct source of supply before attempting isolation.\n- The procedure must follow a logical sequence to ensure no steps are missed.\n- **Lock-out Tag-out (LOTO)** must be used to physically prevent the operation of the isolation device.\n- Only the person performing the work should hold the key to the isolation lock.\n- Verification must be performed at the specific point where work will take place.\n- A circuit is only considered safe once it has been proven dead and the tester has been re-verified.\n\n**How to do it**\nTo perform the JIB-style safe isolation workflow, follow these steps in order. First, identify the circuit or equipment that requires isolation. Second, coordinate with the site users to ensure the disconnection will not cause secondary hazards. Third, operate the isolation device (such as a main switch or circuit breaker) to the 'off' position. Fourth, apply **Lock-out Tag-out (LOTO)** by placing a physical lock on the device and attaching a warning tag. \n\nFifth, verify your test equipment. Use a **Proving Unit** to confirm that your **Approved Voltage Indicator (AVI)** is functioning correctly. Sixth, perform the act of **Proving Dead**. This involves using the **AVI** to check for voltage between all live conductors and between live conductors and earth at the point of work. Finally, return to the **Proving Unit** and re-verify the **AVI**. This ensures the indicator did not fail during the actual test. \n\nThink of this like locking your front door before going on holiday. You don't just close the door; you turn the key (Lock-out), pull the handle to make sure it’s caught (Proving Dead), and then check your key is still in your pocket (Re-proving) to ensure the whole process worked as intended. \n\n*Micro-scenario:* Consider a distribution board where two breakers are labelled 'Sockets'. If you switch off one but do not perform **Proving Dead** at the socket itself, you are relying on a label that may be 20 years old and incorrect.\n\n**Common mistakes**\nLearners often confuse **Safe Isolation** with simple switching; **Safe Isolation** is a verified safety process involving locks and testers, whereas simple switching is just the act of turning a device off without security or verification.\n\nMisconceptions (targeted):\n- Misconception: Switching off the circuit breaker is enough to start work. | Correction: You must physically lock the device and prove the circuit is dead with a verified indicator. | AC: AC3.7\n- Misconception: Any multimeter can be used to check if a circuit is dead. | Correction: Only an **Approved Voltage Indicator (AVI)** should be used, as it is designed to fail-safe and lacks dangerous internal fuses. | AC: AC3.7\n\n**Key Points**\n- Identify and isolate the specific supply.\n- Secure the isolation with a physical lock and tag (**LOTO**).\n- Verify the tool before and after the test using a **Proving Unit**.\n- Confirm the absence of voltage between all conductors and earth (**Proving Dead**).\n\n**Quick recap**\nSafe isolation is a non-negotiable safety sequence. It moves from identifying the supply to physically locking it off, then verifying the circuit is dead using a three-step 'prove-test-prove' method with an **Approved Voltage Indicator (AVI)** and a **Proving Unit**.\n\n### Coming Up Next\nOnce the system is safely isolated, we move to the visual inspection phase to check for physical defects before any electrical tests are performed."

        "title": "Verification Logic & Stop-Triggers",
        "content": "### In this lesson\n- You will learn why we verify test instruments before and after checking for voltage.\n- We will cover the safety rationale for the 'sandwich' test and when you must stop the process.\n- Key takeaways include understanding tool reliability and selecting the correct action when safety obstacles occur.\n\n**What this is**\nVerification logic refers to the 'prove-dead-reprove' cycle. This involves using a **Proving Unit** to verify an **Approved Voltage Indicator (AVI)** immediately before use, performing the test, and then re-verifying the tool immediately after. This cycle ensures that the tool was working when it gave a 'zero' reading. Stop-triggers are specific conditions, such as an unexpected voltage reading or a broken lock, that require an immediate halt to the procedure for safety reasons.\n\n**Why it matters**\nIf an **AVI** fails internally (for example, a broken internal wire or a failed LED) while you are testing a live circuit, it will show a 'dead' reading. Without a **Proving Unit**, you would believe the circuit is safe when it is actually lethal. By re-verifying the tool after the test, you prove that the 'zero' reading was because the circuit was dead, not because the tool was broken. This is a safety-critical logic that prevents fatal errors.\n\n**Key facts / rules**\n- The **AVI** must be checked against a known source (the **Proving Unit**) both before and after the test.\n- A reading of 0V is only valid if the tester is proven functional after the reading is taken.\n- If the **AVI** fails to light up on the **Proving Unit** at any stage, the test is invalid.\n- Any unexpected voltage reading (e.g., 50V on a supposedly isolated circuit) is a stop-trigger.\n- Inability to identify the correct supply or apply a lock is a stop-trigger.\n- Never bypass safety steps to save time; the sequence is the protection.\n\n**How to do it**\nTo apply this logic, start by activating your **Proving Unit** and applying the **AVI** probes to it. Confirm the indicator lights up to its full rated voltage. Next, move to the point of work and perform the check for **Proving Dead**. You must check between Phase and Neutral, Phase and Earth, and Neutral and Earth. If the **AVI** shows no voltage, immediately return to the **Proving Unit** and check the **AVI** again. If it lights up, the circuit is confirmed dead.\n\nIf you encounter an obstacle, such as a missing lock-off point or a distribution board that cannot be secured, you must select the correct safety action: stop and escalate. Do not proceed with the work. Similarly, if your **AVI** shows any voltage where there should be none, treat the system as live, stop the procedure, and report the finding to a supervisor. \n\nImagine testing a torch before walking into a pitch-black basement. You turn it on outside to make sure it works. You walk through the basement (the test). When you get to the other side, you turn it on again. If it doesn't turn on then, you can't be sure if it was working while you were in the dark, or if you just got lucky. \n\n*Micro-scenario:* You prove your **AVI** on the **Proving Unit**, and it works. You check the circuit and it shows 0V. You go back to the **Proving Unit**, but now the **AVI** does not light up. In this case, you must assume the circuit is still live and the tester failed mid-way.\n\n**Common mistakes**\nLearners often confuse **Proving Dead** with checking for a loss of function in a device; **Proving Dead** is a specific measurement of voltage absence using a verified indicator, whereas checking for loss of function (like seeing if a light is off) does not account for neutral faults or alternative live paths.\n\nMisconceptions (targeted):\n- Misconception: If the tester works on the **Proving Unit** first, I don't need to check it again after. | Correction: You must re-prove the tester after the check to ensure it did not fail during the measurement. | AC: AC3.7\n- Misconception: If I find a small amount of 'ghost' voltage, it is safe to ignore it. | Correction: Any unexpected reading is a stop-trigger; you must treat the circuit as live and escalate the issue. | AC: AC3.7\n\n**Key Points**\n- Proving before ensures the tool is working.\n- Proving after ensures the tool *stayed* working during the test.\n- Unexpected readings or missing safety equipment are triggers to stop work.\n- Escalate any safety concerns to a competent person immediately.\n\n**Quick recap**\nThe 'prove-test-prove' cycle is the only way to verify that a 'dead' reading is accurate. If the tool fails or the circuit shows unexpected voltage, you must stop immediately and escalate. This logic ensures that your safety is based on evidence, not assumptions.\n\n### Coming Up Next\nNow that you understand the logic of proving dead, we will look at the specific physical defects you need to look for during a dead inspection."
