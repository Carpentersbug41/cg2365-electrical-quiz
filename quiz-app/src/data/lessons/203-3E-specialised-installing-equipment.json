        "content": "**What this is**\nSpecialised installing equipment refers to the professional-grade tools required to manipulate, shape, and join electrical containment systems. Unlike general-purpose hand tools, these items are specifically engineered to work with steel conduit and cable tray without damaging the material.\n\n**Why it matters**\nIn commercial and industrial environments, cables are housed in metallic containment for mechanical protection. If these systems are installed poorly—with kinked pipes or sharp edges—the cables inside can be damaged during the installation phase. Using the correct specialist equipment ensures the installation is &quot;fit for purpose&quot; and meets the high standards of workmanship required by the IET Wiring Regulations (BS 7671).\n\n**Key rules / facts**\n*   **Conduit benders** must use a **former** that matches the diameter of the conduit (e.g., 20mm or 25mm) to prevent kinking.\n*   **Stocks and dies** require the use of **cutting compound** (oil) to prevent damage to the die teeth and ensure a clean thread.\n*   All cut ends of conduit must be **deburred** using a reamer or file to remove sharp edges that could strip cable insulation.\n*   **Tray benders** are used specifically for the side flanges of the tray to allow for height or direction changes.\n*   Standard conduit sizes in the UK are typically 20mm and 25mm.\n\n**How to use it**\n1. **Identify the material**: Determine if you are working with galvanized steel conduit, PVC conduit, or cable tray.\n2. **Select the tool**: Choose a conduit bender for pipe or a tray bender for sheet metal.\n3. **Check the former**: Ensure the former radius matches the conduit size (20mm or 25mm) to prevent kinking.\n4. **Apply lubrication**: Use cutting oil when using stocks and dies to thread steel.\n5. **Clean the joint**: Deburr all edges and wipe away excess oil before assembly to ensure a secure mechanical connection.\n\n**Common mistakes**\n*   Using the wrong size former, which leads to &quot;kinking&quot; or flattening of the conduit.\n*   Forgetting to deburr the inside of a cut conduit, which creates a sharp edge that damages cables.\n*   Applying too much force to a tray bender, which can crack the protective galvanized coating and lead to corrosion.\n\n**Quick recap**\n*   Conduit benders and formers create smooth, non-restrictive bends.\n*   Stocks and dies provide the threaded connections needed for secure mechanical joints.\n*   Proper tool selection prevents cable damage and ensures a professional, compliant finish."
