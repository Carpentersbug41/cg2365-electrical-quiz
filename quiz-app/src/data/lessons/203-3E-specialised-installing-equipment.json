        "content": "**Rig-safe + Scope Statement**\nThis lesson is **knowledge-only**: it focuses on identifying equipment and its purpose. We are **not** teaching operation steps, safe use, or practical technique here. In the real world, tools must only be used with correct training, PPE, risk assessment, and supervision.\n\n**What this is**\nSpecialised installing equipment refers to the specific kit electricians use to shape, prepare, and install **containment systems**. Containment includes items like steel or PVC conduit and cable tray. These tools are designed for structural work rather than electrical terminations.\n\n**Why it matters**\nUsing the correct specialist tool is essential for professional workmanship. It ensures that bends are accurate, joints are secure, and most importantly, that cables are protected. If a tool is chosen incorrectly, it can lead to weak structures or sharp edges that strip cable insulation, creating a significant safety hazard.\n\n**Key rules / facts**\n- **Conduit benders** are used specifically for **bending conduit** (tubing) to route cables neatly around corners or obstacles.\n- **Tray benders** are used for **bending and shaping cable tray** sections so the tray follows the required building route.\n- **Formers** are internal components of a bender that control the **shape and radius** of a bend, ensuring the conduit doesn't kink or flatten.\n- **Stocks & dies** are a precision tool set used for **cutting a thread onto steel conduit**. This allows the conduit to be screwed securely into fittings like couplers or boxes.\n- **Reaming** is a mandatory step after cutting or threading; it involves smoothing internal edges so **cables are not damaged** during the 'pull-in' phase.\n\n**How to use this knowledge**\nWhen selecting equipment for a job, follow this simple workflow:\n1. Identify the **containment type**: Is it conduit (tube) or tray (flat support)?\n2. Identify the **task type**: Do you need to bend it, thread it, or smooth it?\n3. Match the tool: Bend conduit → Conduit bender; Thread conduit → Stocks & dies; Shape tray → Tray bender.\n\n**Common mistakes**\n- **Tool Mixing**: Attempting to use conduit tools on cable tray. They are not interchangeable as they are designed for different structural shapes.\n- **Purpose Confusion**: Thinking stocks & dies are for cutting conduit to length. They are specifically for **threading** the ends.\n- **Skipping Reaming**: Ignoring the smoothing of internal edges. This is the most common cause of cable insulation failure in containment systems.\n\n**Quick recap**\n- Conduit bender + former = **shape and bend conduit**.\n- Tray bender = **shape and bend cable tray**.\n- Stocks & dies = **thread steel conduit** for screw-fit connections."
