Real installations often make it harder for cables to lose heat:\n- surrounded by insulation\n- grouped with other cables\n- installed in hotter ambient temperatures\n\nIf the protective device allows more current than the cable can safely carry, the cable can overheat before the device trips.\n\n**Key rules / facts**\n- **Ib (Design Current):** expected normal current for the load.\n- **In (Protective Device Rating):** rating printed on the fuse/MCB.\n- **It (Tabulated Current):** the cable’s current rating in tables at reference conditions.\n- **Iz (Actual Current Capacity):** the cable’s safe rating once real-world factors are applied.\n- **Correction factors** (often < 1) reduce usable capacity.\n\n**Two linked equations (memorise the idea, not the vibe):**\n- **Iz = It × Ctotal** (real capacity after heat penalties)\n- **Required It ≥ In ÷ Ctotal** (find the minimum table value you must choose)\n\n**The Golden Rule:**\n**Ib ≤ In ≤ Iz**\n\n**How to use it (repeatable steps)**\n1) Identify **Ib** from the load.\n2) Choose **In** so **In ≥ Ib**.\n3) Identify correction factors (e.g., Ca, Cg, Ci).\n4) Multiply them to get **Ctotal**.\n5) Calculate: **Required It ≥ In ÷ Ctotal**.\n6) Choose a cable from the tables with **It** at least that value.\n7) (Sanity check) Because **Ctotal < 1**, required **It** will normally be **bigger than In**.\n\n**Quick recap**\n- Ib = load, In = breaker, It = table value, Iz = real value.\n- **Iz = It × Ctotal**\n- Safe chain: **Ib ≤ In ≤ Iz**"
