        "content": "**What this is**\nCable sizing is the logic used to pick a conductor that won't melt or start a fire. It is not about guessing; it is a mathematical process of ensuring the cable can handle more heat than the protective device allows to pass through it.\n\n**Why it matters**\nElectricity generates heat. If a cable is buried in insulation or bunched with other cables, it cannot shed heat effectively. If the circuit breaker (In) allows 32A to flow, but the cable can only safely handle 20A in those hot conditions, the cable will burn before the breaker ever trips.\n\n**Key rules / facts**\n*   **Ib (Design Current):** What the load pulls. This is your starting point.\n*   **In (Protective Device):** The rating of your fuse/MCB. It must be at least as big as Ib.\n*   **Iz (Effective Capacity):** The real-world limit of the cable. It MUST be bigger than In.\n*   **The Golden Rule:** Ib ≤ In ≤ Iz. This must always be true for a safe circuit.\n*   **Correction Factors:** Multipliers like Ca (Ambient Temp), Cg (Grouping), and Ci (Insulation) that reduce the cable's capacity.\n\n**How to use it**\n1.  Identify **Ib** from the equipment load.\n2.  Select a protective device **In** that is greater than or equal to Ib.\n3.  Identify all **Correction Factors** (e.g., Ca, Cg, Ci).\n4.  Multiply factors together to get **Ctotal**.\n5.  Calculate the **Minimum Required It** using the formula: Required It ≥ In ÷ Ctotal.\n6.  Select a cable from the tables where its tabulated value (**It**) meets this requirement.\n\n**Common mistakes**\n*   **Adding factors:** You must multiply factors (e.g., 0.8 × 0.7), never add them.\n*   **Mixing up It and Iz:** Remember that **It** is the value in the book; **Iz** is the value on the wall after it gets hot.\n*   **Wrong inequality:** Thinking the cable only needs to be bigger than the load (Ib). It must be bigger than the protection (In).\n\n**Quick recap**\n*   Ib is the load, In is the breaker, Iz is the actual cable limit.\n*   The safety chain is **Ib ≤ In ≤ Iz**.\n*   Correction factors are 'heat penalties' that usually make the required cable size larger."
