        "title": "The Path of the Current",
        "content": "A **one-way lighting circuit** using a 3-plate ceiling rose is the standard method for wiring lights in the UK. The fundamental rule to remember is that the **switch breaks the Line (live) conductor**, never the Neutral. This *reduces the chance* of a live contact at the lamp holder when the switch is OFF — and it is one reason we later confirm **polarity** during dead testing.\n\n### 1. The Permanent Live Path (The Loop)\nThe journey begins at the **Consumer Unit (CU)**. The Line conductor travels to the ceiling rose and terminates in the **Loop terminals**. This is a permanent live group. From this same group, a conductor (the switch feed) travels down to the **COM (Common)** terminal of the switch. This part of the circuit is always live as long as the breaker is on.\n\n### 2. The Switched Live Path (The Return)\nWhen the switch is toggled to the &apos;ON&apos; position, it creates a bridge between the **COM** and **L1** terminals. The conductor connected to L1 is the **switched live**. It travels back up to the ceiling rose and terminates in the third, separate terminal (the switched live terminal). This terminal is then connected directly to the lamp live. It only becomes live when the switch is closed.\n\n### 3. The Neutral Path\nThe Neutral conductor from the CU goes directly to the **Neutral group** in the ceiling rose. The lamp&apos;s neutral wire also connects to this group. Unlike the live wire, the neutral is not interrupted by the switch; it provides the continuous return path for the current from the lamp back to the supply.\n\n### 4. The CPC (Earth) Path\nThe **Circuit Protective Conductor (CPC)** must be continuous throughout. It runs from the CU to the ceiling rose and then to the switch box. Even if you are using plastic accessories, the CPC must be terminated into the provided earth terminals **or an insulated connector block** to maintain the earth path for the entire circuit.\n\n### 5. Termination Map Summary\nIn a 3-plate rose, you have three distinct blocks:\n1. **Loop:** CU Live and Switch Feed (COM).\n2. **Neutral:** CU Neutral and Lamp Neutral.\n3. **Switched Live:** Switch Return (L1) and Lamp Live.\n\n**Non-negotiable rule:** the lamp live connects only to the **Switched Live** terminal — **never** into the Loop/permanent live group.\n\n### 6. Pre-flight Inspection\nBefore any testing with meters, you must perform a visual **dead inspection**.\n- Look for &apos;Stop-and-Fix&apos; issues: **exposed copper** outside of terminals, **loose terminations** (the &apos;tug test&apos;), and **missing/unterminated CPC** connections.\n- Ensure the cable sheath enters the accessory box and that all switched lives are correctly identified with **brown sleeving**.\n\n**Decision gate (inspection-only):**\n- **Pass:** safe and clear to proceed to dead tests.\n- **Suspicious:** correct/verify before metering (could distort results).\n- **Stop-and-Fix:** do not continue until corrected (safety/validity risk)."
