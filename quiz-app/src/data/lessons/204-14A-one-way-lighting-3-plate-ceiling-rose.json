Do not open or work on real lighting circuits unless you are trained/supervised and the circuit is safely isolated and proven dead.\n\nIf you’ve never seen these parts before, start with the physical picture.\n\n## A) What you see at a 3-plate ceiling rose\nA typical 3-plate ceiling rose has **three separate terminal groups** (think: three labelled slots/buckets):\n\n1) **Neutral group (N):** where neutrals join together (supply neutral + lamp neutral).\n2) **Loop group (Permanent Live / Loop):** where permanent lives join together (the live feed(s) and the live that feeds the switch).\n3) **Switched live group:** where the switched live return joins the lamp live.\n\nYou may also see an **earth/CPC terminal or connector** where all CPCs are joined.\n\n## B) What you see at a one-way switch\nA one-way switch typically has:\n- **COM (Common):** the input (it receives the permanent live feed)\n- **L1 (or “1”):** the output (it becomes live only when the switch is ON)\n- an **earth terminal/connection point** (CPC must be terminated/connected as required on the rig)\n\n## C) The single most important beginner rule\n**The lamp live must NOT go into the Loop (permanent live) group.**\n- Loop group = “always live when the circuit is on.”\n- Lamp live must be “only live when the switch is on,” so it belongs in the **Switched live group**.\n\n## D) Identification (why sleeving exists)\nSometimes a core colour doesn’t match its job (especially in switch-drop cables). **Any core used as live must be identified as live (brown) at the ends.**"
