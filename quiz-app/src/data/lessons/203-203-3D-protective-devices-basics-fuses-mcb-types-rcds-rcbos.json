        "content": "**What this is**\nProtective devices are the safety valves of an electrical installation. They automatically disconnect the supply when a fault occurs. This lesson focuses on recognising these devices and matching them to their purpose. **Note: You are not learning how to design or fit these yet; you are learning what each device protects against and when it is used.**\n\n**Why it matters**\nUsing the wrong device can lead to two dangerous outcomes: it might trip when there is no fault (nuisance tripping), or it might fail to trip during a real hazard, leading to fire or fatal electric shock.\n\n**Key rules / facts**\n*   **Overcurrent protection:** Fuses and MCBs protect the **cable** from melting due to overload or short-circuits.\n*   **Additional protection:** RCDs protect **people** from electric shock by detecting earth leakage (residual current).\n*   **MCB Types:** Different 'trip curves' handle inrush currents:\n    *   **Type B:** Standard domestic circuits (low inrush).\n    *   **Type C:** Commercial/Industrial (medium inrush, e.g., motors, fluorescent lights).\n    *   **Type D:** Specialist industrial (high inrush, e.g., large transformers, X-ray machines).\n*   **RCBO:** A single device that combines the functions of an MCB and an RCD.\n\n**How to use it (Selection Logic)**\n1.  **Identify the hazard:** Is the main risk cable damage (overcurrent) or human shock (leakage)?\n2.  **Check the load type:** Does the equipment have a high startup surge (inrush)?\n3.  **Select the family:** Use an OCPD (MCB/Fuse) for cables; use an RCD for shock protection.\n4.  **Refine the OCPD:** Choose Type B for houses, Type C for motors, Type D for heavy machinery.\n\n**Common mistakes**\n*   **Thinking an RCD replaces an MCB:** An RCD alone will NOT protect a cable from an overload; it only looks for leakage.\n*   **Using Type D everywhere:** This is dangerous as it may not trip fast enough on a standard circuit.\n*   **Mixing up overload and leakage:** Overload is too many kettles; leakage is a wire touching the metal casing.\n\n**Quick recap**\n*   MCBs/Fuses protect cables against overcurrent.\n*   RCDs protect people against earth leakage/shock.\n*   RCBOs provide both overcurrent and earth leakage protection in one unit."
