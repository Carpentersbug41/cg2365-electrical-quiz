        "content": "**Direct Current (DC)**\nDC flows in **one direction only**, from positive to negative, continuously. Think of a battery — the current always flows the same way through your circuit.\n\n**Common DC sources:**\n- Batteries (AA, car battery, phone battery)\n- Solar panels\n- DC power supplies\n- USB chargers (output DC even though they plug into AC mains)\n\n**Alternating Current (AC)**\nAC **reverses direction** periodically. It flows forward, then backward, then forward again, in a continuous cycle. The electrons don't travel far — they just vibrate back and forth.\n\n**Common AC sources:**\n- Mains electricity (wall sockets)\n- Generators in power stations\n- Car alternators\n\n**Why use AC for mains?**\n- **Easy to transform**: AC voltage can be easily stepped up or down using transformers\n- **Efficient transmission**: High voltage AC loses less energy over long distances\n- **Easy to generate**: Power stations naturally produce AC from rotating generators\n\n**Key Point:** Although AC reverses direction, we still measure it in amps (A) and volts (V), just like DC. But AC has an extra property: **frequency**."

It can vary slightly (e.g., 220V to 240V is acceptable), but we call it 230V.\n\n**Historical Note:**\nOlder installations may have been rated at 240V. The UK adopted the European standard of 230V, but the actual voltage didn't change much — equipment rated for 240V still works fine.\n\n**Wiring Colors (Important for Safety):**\n- **Live (L):** Brown wire — carries the AC voltage\n- **Neutral (N):** Blue wire — return path (near 0V)\n- **Earth (E):** Green/Yellow striped — safety connection (0V)\n\n**Safety Notes:**\n- Mains AC at 230V is **dangerous** and can be fatal\n- Always isolate circuits before working on them\n- Never work on live mains equipment unless qualified\n- Use appropriate PPE and follow regulations\n\n**Common Mains-Powered Devices:**\n- Lighting circuits\n- Household appliances (kettles, TVs, washing machines)\n- Power tools\n- Heating systems"
