        "title": "Understanding Enclosure Fill",
        "content": "When installing cables in **conduit** (tubular enclosures) or **trunking** (rectangular enclosures), we cannot simply pack them until they are full. **Space factor** (also known as enclosure fill) is the ratio of the total area of the cables to the available internal area of the enclosure, expressed as a percentage.\n\n### Why Space Factor Matters\nOverfilling an enclosure creates three primary risks:\n1. **Mechanical Damage:** If a conduit is too full, there is high friction during the 'pulling in' phase. This can snag or tear the cable insulation, leading to short circuits or earth faults later.\n2. **Heat Removal (Thermal Risk):** Cables generate heat when carrying current. If they are packed too tightly, there is no air gap for cooling. This causes heat to build up, potentially melting insulation or causing a fire.\n3. **Future-Proofing:** Good workmanship involves leaving space for future additions or maintenance. A 100% full trunking is impossible to work on later.\n\n### Key Rules / Facts\n- Always use the **internal diameter (ID)** of conduit, not the external size.\n- Calculate the **Cross-sectional Area (CSA)** of every cable individually.\n- Space factor is always calculated using **areas**, never by adding diameters together.\n- Formula for circle area: **Area = π × r²** (where r is half the diameter).\n- Formula for rectangle area: **Area = Width × Height**.\n- Formula for % Fill: **(Total Cable Area ÷ Enclosure Area) × 100**.\n\n### How to Calculate Fill\nTo determine the space factor, you first find the internal area of the enclosure. For a 20mm conduit, the radius is 10mm, so the area is π × 10² ≈ 314mm². Next, find the area of each cable using its overall diameter. Finally, divide the sum of all cable areas by the enclosure area and multiply by 100.\n\n### Common Mistakes\nElectricians often make the mistake of using the **outside diameter** of a conduit, which includes the thickness of the plastic or steel, leading to an incorrect (overestimated) available space. Another common error is adding cable diameters together (e.g., three 6mm cables = 18mm) and comparing that to the conduit diameter; this is mathematically incorrect because it ignores the gaps between the circular cables.\n\n### Quick Recap\nSpace factor ensures cables can be pulled in without damage and have enough air to stay cool. We calculate it by comparing the total cable area to the internal enclosure area."
