        "title": "Understanding Space Factor",
        "content": "When installing cables in **conduit** (tubular enclosures) or **trunking** (rectangular enclosures), you cannot simply pack them until they are tight. The **space factor** (also known as enclosure fill) is the ratio of the total area of the cables to the internal area of the enclosure, expressed as a percentage.\n\nWhy does this matter? There are three critical reasons:\n\n1. **Mechanical Damage:** If an enclosure is too full, there is high friction during the 'pulling in' phase. This can snag cables at bends and tear the insulation, leading to immediate or future faults.\n\n2. **Heat Removal (Thermal Risk):** Cables generate heat when carrying current. If they are packed too tightly, there is no air circulation to carry that heat away. Overheating causes insulation to become brittle and fail prematurely.\n\n3. **Workmanship and Future Proofing:** A professional installation allows 'headroom' for future additions and ensures maintenance can be carried out without damaging existing circuits.\n\n**Key rules / facts:**\n* Space factor is always expressed as a **percentage (%)**.\n* It is based on the **internal area** of the enclosure, not the outside dimensions.\n* Overfilling causes **mechanical stress** and **thermal buildup**.\n* You must add the **areas** of cables, not just their diameters.\n\nIn summary, space factor ensures cables can be installed safely and operate without overheating."

If cables are different sizes, calculate each separately and add them together.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Percentage Fill**\n* Use the formula: $\\% \\text{ fill} = (\\text{Total Cable Area} \\div \\text{Enclosure Area}) \\times 100$.\n\n**Key rules / facts:**\n* Always use the **internal** diameter of conduit.\n* Calculate in **millimetres (mm)** to get areas in $mm^2$.\n* Never add diameters together; you must add the **calculated areas**.\n* If your result is above the limit provided in regulations (e.g., 45% for some trunking), the installation is non-compliant.\n\n**Common Mistakes:**\n* Using the outside diameter of a conduit (which includes the pipe wall).\n* Forgetting to square the radius in the circle formula.\n* Forgetting to multiply by 100 at the end."
