        "title": "Understanding Space Factor",
        "content": "When installing cables inside **conduit** (tubular enclosures) or **trunking** (rectangular enclosures), you cannot simply pack them until they are full. There is a physical and safety limit to how much space these cables should occupy, known as the **space factor** or **enclosure fill**. \n\n**What this is:** Space factor is a ratio, expressed as a percentage, comparing the total cross-sectional area of all cables to the available internal area of the enclosure. If a conduit has an internal area of 100mm² and the cables take up 40mm², the space factor is 40%. \n\n**Why it matters:** \n1. **Mechanical Damage:** If an enclosure is too full, pulling cables through becomes difficult. High friction can lead to snagging at bends, which may tear or scrape the insulation, causing faults. \n2. **Thermal Risk:** Cables generate heat when carrying current. Packed cables have less air surrounding them to carry that heat away. Overheating leads to insulation breakdown and a significantly reduced cable lifespan. \n3. **Workmanship:** Leaving 'headroom' allows for future maintenance or additions, which is a hallmark of professional installation. \n\n**Key rules / facts:** \n- Always use the **internal diameter (ID)** of the conduit, not the outside size. \n- You must add the **areas** of the cables together, not just their diameters. \n- Percentage Fill = (Total Cable Area ÷ Enclosure Internal Area) × 100. \n- For conduit (circles), use the formula **Area = πr²**. \n- For trunking (rectangles), use **Area = Width × Height**. \n\n**How to use it:** To determine if an installation is safe, you calculate the area of the enclosure, calculate the total area of all cables inside, and find the percentage. If this percentage exceeds the limit set by regulations or design specifications, the enclosure is too small. \n\n**Common mistakes:** Students often use the outside diameter of a conduit, which includes the thickness of the pipe wall, leading to an incorrect area. Another common error is forgetting to square the radius (r²) in the circle formula or mixing units like centimeters and millimeters. \n\n**Quick recap:** Space factor measures how full an enclosure is. We calculate it using areas to prevent heat buildup and mechanical damage during cable pulling."
