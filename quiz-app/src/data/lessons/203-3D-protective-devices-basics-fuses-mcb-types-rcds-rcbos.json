        "content": "**What this is**\nProtective devices are the safety valves of an electrical installation. They automatically disconnect the supply when a fault occurs. This lesson focuses on recognising these devices and matching them to their purpose. **You are not learning how to design or fit these yet; you are learning what each device protects against and when it is used.**\n\n**Why it matters**\nUsing the wrong device can lead to two dangerous outcomes: it might trip when there is no fault (nuisance tripping), or it might fail to trip during a real hazard, increasing the risk of fire or serious electric shock.\n\n**Key rules / facts**\n* **Overcurrent protection (cables):** **Fuses and MCBs** protect the **cable** from overheating due to **overload** or **short-circuit**.\n* **Earth leakage protection (people):** **RCDs** detect **residual current** (an imbalance between line and neutral), which usually means current is leaking to earth.\n* **MCB Types (inrush handling):** Different trip behaviours reduce nuisance tripping on startup surges:\n  * **Type B:** Low inrush (typical domestic circuits).\n  * **Type C:** Medium inrush (motors, some commercial lighting).\n  * **Type D:** High inrush (specialist industrial equipment).\n* **RCBO:** One device that provides **both** overcurrent protection (like an MCB) and earth leakage protection (like an RCD).\n\n**How to use it (Selection Logic)**\n1) **Name the hazards:** Overcurrent? Earth leakage? (or both)\n2) **Choose the family:**\n   - Overcurrent only → **MCB or fuse**\n   - Earth leakage only → **RCD** (but remember: still needs overcurrent protection elsewhere)\n   - Both together → **RCBO**\n3) **Choose the MCB type (B/C/D):** Based on whether the load has low/medium/high inrush.\n4) **State the selection clearly:** “Type B RCBO for a domestic lighting circuit requiring additional protection.”\n\n**Common mistakes (traps)**\n* **Thinking an RCD replaces an MCB:** An RCD alone will NOT protect a cable from overload/short-circuit.\n* **Picking Type D ‘to be safe’:** Type D can be inappropriate on normal circuits and may not disconnect quickly enough in some fault situations.\n* **Mixing overload vs leakage:** Overload = too much load; leakage = current escaping to earth.\n\n**Quick recap**\n* MCBs/Fuses = overcurrent (cables)\n* RCDs = earth leakage (people)\n* RCBOs = both (one module)\n* B/C/D = how tolerant the breaker is to startup surges"
