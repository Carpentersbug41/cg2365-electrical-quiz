        "content": "In the electrical industry, safety is not optional. It is governed by **Statutory Regulations**. A statutory regulation is a law. This means you **must** follow it. If you fail to comply, you can be prosecuted in a criminal court, resulting in heavy fines or even imprisonment. \n\nIt is vital to distinguish between statutory and non-statutory documents. **Statutory regulations are the law.** Non-statutory documents, such as **BS 7671 (The IET Wiring Regulations)**, are guidance. While BS 7671 is not a law itself, following it is the best way to prove you have complied with the statutory Electricity at Work Regulations. \n\nBelow is the 'range' of statutory regulations you must know, with a one-line purpose for each: \n\n1. **HASAWA (Health and Safety at Work Act):** The primary law that sets out the general duties of employers and employees to ensure workplace safety. \n2. **EAWR (Electricity at Work Regulations):** Controls electrical work so that systems and activities are safe and do not cause danger. \n3. **ESQCR (Electricity Safety, Quality and Continuity Regulations):** Primarily for suppliers to protect the public and ensure a constant power supply. \n4. **PUWER (Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations):** Ensures that all work equipment (like drills or ladders) is safe to use and maintained. \n5. **COSHH (Control of Substances Hazardous to Health):** Controls the use of dangerous substances like cleaning chemicals, lead, or solder fumes. \n6. **CDM (Construction Design and Management):** Manages the health, safety, and welfare of everyone involved in a construction project. \n7. **Manual Handling Operations Regulations:** Sets rules to prevent injuries when lifting, carrying, or moving heavy loads. \n8. **PPE at Work Regulations:** Requires employers to provide and ensure the use of protective gear where risks cannot be controlled otherwise. \n9. **Noise at Work Regulations:** Protects workers' hearing from damage caused by loud environments. \n10. **Environmental Protection Act:** Prevents pollution and ensures the safe disposal of waste materials. \n11. **Equality Act (DDA):** Ensures fair treatment and prevents discrimination in the workplace. \n\nIf these laws are breached, the **Health and Safety Executive (HSE)** can issue **Improvement Notices** (giving you time to fix a problem) or **Prohibition Notices** (stopping work immediately because it is too dangerous). Serious breaches lead to court cases, fines, and jail time."
