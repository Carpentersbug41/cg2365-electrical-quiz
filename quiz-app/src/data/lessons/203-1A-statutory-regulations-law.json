If you do not comply, regulators can take **enforcement action** (notices), and serious breaches can lead to **prosecution**, **fines**, and in extreme cases **imprisonment**.\n\nIt is vital to distinguish between **statutory** and **non-statutory** documents:\n- **Statutory regulations = the law** (legally enforceable)\n- **Non-statutory documents = guidance/standards** (not law), such as **BS 7671 (IET Wiring Regulations)**\n\n**Key point:** BS 7671 is not law, but it is a widely accepted technical standard used to show you have met your duties under laws like the **Electricity at Work Regulations (EAWR)**.\n\nBelow is the **statutory range** for Unit 203, with a one-line purpose for each:\n\n1. **HASAWA (Health and Safety at Work Act):** Sets general duties on employers and employees to keep people safe at work.\n2. **EAWR (Electricity at Work Regulations):** Requires electrical systems and work activities to be carried out safely to prevent danger.\n3. **ESQCR (Electricity Safety, Quality and Continuity Regulations):** Controls safety, quality, and continuity of the public electricity supply (mainly suppliers/distributors).\n4. **PUWER (Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations):** Ensures work equipment is suitable, maintained, and safe to use.\n5. **COSHH (Control of Substances Hazardous to Health):** Controls exposure to hazardous substances (e.g., fumes, dusts, chemicals).\n6. **CDM (Construction Design and Management):** Sets health and safety duties for construction projects (planning, coordination, welfare).\n7. **Manual Handling Operations Regulations:** Reduces injury risk from lifting, carrying, pushing, or pulling loads.\n8. **PPE at Work Regulations:** Requires suitable PPE to be provided and used when risks cannot be controlled by other methods.\n9. **Noise at Work Regulations:** Protects workers from hearing damage caused by high noise exposure.\n10. **Environmental Protection Act (Environmental Act):** Prevents pollution and controls safe handling/disposal of waste.\n11. **DDA (Disability Discrimination Act):** Protects against disability discrimination (now largely covered under equality legislation).\n12. **Equal Opportunities (Equality legislation):** Prevents unfair treatment/discrimination and supports fair access at work.\n\nIf these laws are breached, the **HSE** (or relevant regulator) can issue:\n- **Improvement Notices** (fix within a set time)\n- **Prohibition Notices** (stop work immediately due to serious risk)\n\nSerious breaches may result in court action, fines, and (in extreme cases) imprisonment."
