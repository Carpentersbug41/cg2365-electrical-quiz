        "content": "**Rule 1 (Current):** Current is the same everywhere in a series circuit.\n\n**Rule 2 (Voltage):** Supply voltage is shared between components. The voltage drops across each component add up to the total supply voltage.\n\n**Rule 3 (Resistance):** Total resistance is the sum of individual resistances.\n\n**Why these rules work:**\n\nKeep your eyes on the diagram: there's only **one path** (no branches). Since charge has nowhere else to go, the same current must flow through each component. Think of water in a single pipe — the same amount flows everywhere.\n\nFor voltage, energy is used up as current passes through each resistor, so the supply voltage is divided between them.\n\nFor resistance, each resistor adds to the total opposition to current flow, so we simply add them together."
