        "title": "Proving the Circuit is Safe",
        "content": "Before we ever connect an installation to the **UK mains supply** (which delivers **Alternating Current (AC)** at **230V** and **50Hz**), we must prove it is safe. We do this using 'Dead Tests.' While AC current flows back and forth 50 times a second, our test equipment usually uses a small DC battery to check the 'plumbing' of the circuit while it is dead.\n\n### 1. Continuity: The 'Should be Connected' Test\nContinuity answers the question: **Is the wire broken?** We want the copper path to be continuous from one end to the other. Because copper is an excellent conductor, we expect a **low resistance** reading, measured in **Ohms (Ω)**. A 'good' reading is typically very small (e.g., 0.2Ω). If the reading is high or 'Open Circuit,' the wire is likely snapped or a connection is loose.\n\n### 2. Insulation Resistance (IR): The 'Must Not be Connected' Test\nIR answers the question: **Is the current staying inside the wire?** We are testing the plastic (insulation) surrounding the copper. We want the resistance between two different wires (like Line and Earth) to be as high as possible so that no current can 'leak' across. We measure this in **Megohms (MΩ)**. A 'good' reading is **very high** (e.g., >200MΩ). A low reading here is 'suspicious' and suggests the insulation is damaged.\n\n### 3. Polarity: The 'Right Place' Test\nPolarity answers the question: **Is the Line in the right terminal?** It is not about a specific number, but about **identity**. We must ensure that the Line conductor goes to the fuse and the switches, not the Neutral. If we get this wrong, a light switch might turn off the Neutral, leaving the light bulb 'live' even when switched off—a deadly mistake.\n\n### Measurement vs. Conclusion\nAs an electrician, you must distinguish between the **measurement** (the number on the screen) and the **conclusion** (what it means). \n1. **Measurement:** 0.3Ω.\n2. **Conclusion:** The continuity is good; the path is unbroken.\n\nBy following this logic, we ensure that when we finally 'energize' the circuit with AC power, the current goes exactly where it is supposed to go and nowhere else."
