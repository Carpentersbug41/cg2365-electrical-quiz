        "title": "The Language of Safety: Why We Test",
        "content": "Before an electrical installation is ever energized with alternating current (AC), we must prove it is safe. We do this through **dead testing**. Dead testing is not just about getting numbers; it is about answering specific questions about the circuit's integrity.\n\n1. **Continuity: The Logic of 'Togetherness'**\nContinuity asks: **&quot;Should these points be connected?&quot;** When we test a conductor from one end to the other (like a Ring Final circuit or a Protective Earth), the answer is a definite yes. Because we want current to flow easily through the copper, we expect a **low resistance**, measured in **Ohms (Ω)**. A reading of 0.2 Ω is typically 'good', while a reading of 500 Ω would be 'suspicious' because it suggests a loose connection or a broken wire.\n\n2. **Insulation Resistance (IR): The Logic of 'Separation'**\nIR asks: **&quot;Must these points be disconnected?&quot;** We test the insulation between the Line and Neutral, and between all Live conductors and Earth. We want to ensure that current cannot leak through the PVC insulation. Therefore, we expect a **very high resistance**, measured in **Megohms (MΩ)**. On a new circuit, we often see readings greater than 999 MΩ. A reading of 0.01 MΩ would be a major failure, indicating the insulation is damaged and a short circuit is likely.\n\n3. **Polarity: The Logic of 'Location'**\nPolarity asks: **&quot;Is the Line conductor in the right place?&quot;** This isn't a search for a specific number, but a check of identity. We must ensure that the switches, fuses, and circuit breakers are all installed in the **Line conductor**, not the Neutral. If a switch is accidentally put in the Neutral conductor, the appliance will turn off, but the internal wiring remains 'Live' at 230V, creating a deadly trap for anyone maintaining it.\n\n4. **Measurement vs. Conclusion**\nAs an electrician, you must distinguish between the **measurement** (the number on the screen) and the **conclusion** (the meaning of that number). A reading of 0.5 Ω might be a 'Pass' for a long circuit, but 'Suspicious' for a very short one. You are not just a meter-reader; you are a safety investigator. You use the units to guide you: Ohms for things that should touch, and Megohms for things that must stay apart."
