        "title": "The Logic of Dead Testing",
        "content": "Before any new electrical installation is connected to the mains supply, we must prove it is safe. We do this through **Dead Testing**. These tests don&apos;t just give us numbers; they answer specific logical questions about the circuit.\n\n1. **Continuity: &quot;Should it be connected?&quot;**\nContinuity proves that a conductor is unbroken from start to finish. If we are testing an Earth wire (CPC) or a ring final circuit, we want the resistance to be **low**. A low reading in Ohms (Ω) proves the wire is intact and the connections are tight. If the reading is &apos;Open Circuit&apos; or very high, the path is broken.\n\n2. **Insulation Resistance (IR): &quot;Must it NOT be connected?&quot;**\nWhile continuity checks that a single wire is whole, IR checks that two *different* wires (like Line and Neutral) are properly separated by insulation. We want this resistance to be **extremely high**. Because we are looking for a &apos;lack of connection,&apos; we measure this in Megohms (MΩ). A &quot;good&quot; reading is usually hundreds of millions of ohms. A low reading suggests the insulation is damaged and current might leak between wires.\n\n3. **Polarity: &quot;Is it in the right place?&quot;**\nPolarity isn&apos;t about how much resistance there is; it&apos;s about **identity and location**. We must prove that the Line conductor goes to the fuse and the switch, and never the Neutral or Earth. If a switch is in the Neutral wire, the appliance might look &apos;off&apos; but the internal components remain live and dangerous. Polarity ensures the &apos;hot&apos; wire is the one being interrupted by the switch.\n\n**Measurement vs. Conclusion**\nAn electrician must distinguish between the **reading** (what the screen says) and the **conclusion** (what that means). \n\n- A reading of 0.02 Ω is a measurement.\n- If that measurement is for a short piece of copper wire, the **conclusion** is that the continuity is &quot;Good&quot;.\n- If that same 0.02 Ω reading was found during an Insulation Resistance test, the **conclusion** would be &quot;Fail/Danger&quot; because it means the two wires are touching."
