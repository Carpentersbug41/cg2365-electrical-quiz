        "content": "### In this lesson\nThis lesson explores the technical and environmental requirements for installing small-scale energy systems. You will learn how to assess a location to ensure it is fit for purpose and safe for the equipment.\n\n**What this is**\n**Micro-generation** is the production of energy on a small scale. Before installing, you must understand the technology types:\n*   **Solar Photovoltaic (PV):** Panels that convert sunlight directly into electricity.\n*   **Solar Thermal:** Collectors that use sunlight to heat water stored in a cylinder.\n*   **Wind Turbines:** Rotors that capture kinetic wind energy to generate electricity.\n*   **Heat Pumps:** Devices that transfer heat from the air or ground into a building.\n\nTo ensure these systems work, installers must verify **Site Suitability**. This involves checking the physical space, the available energy resource (sun or wind), and the existing infrastructure.\n\n**Why it matters**\nInstalling a system in a poor location results in low energy yields and safety hazards. For example, if a solar array is placed in a shaded area, its output drops significantly. Even worse, failing to account for **Structural Integrity**—the building's ability to hold the equipment's weight—could lead to roof collapse. Imagine placing a heavy safe on a weak bookshelf; the shelf will bow or break. Similarly, a roof must handle the \"dead load\" of the panels and the \"live load\" of wind pushing against them.\n\n**Key facts / rules**\n*   **The Golden Rule of Suitability:** A south-facing roof is only suitable if it is **free from shading** AND has the **structural integrity** to support the system.\n*   **Orientation vs. Tilt:** Orientation is the compass direction (e.g., South); Tilt is the angle up from the ground.\n*   **Regulatory Constraints:** Local rules may limit installation. For example, a wind turbine extending more than 3 meters above the roofline often requires special planning permission.\n*   **Access:** You must ensure safe access for future maintenance.\n\n**How to do it**\n1.  **Check Orientation:** Use a compass to confirm the surface faces the optimal direction (usually South in the Northern Hemisphere).\n2.  **Verify Structure:** Inspect rafters or mounting surfaces to ensure they meet manufacturer load specifications (Structural Integrity).\n3.  **Check Regulations:** Consult local planning guidelines. Ask: \"Does this turbine height violate the 3-meter rule?\" or \"Is this a conservation area?\"\n4.  **Analyze Shading:** Confirm the site is clear of trees or chimneys that would block the energy source.\n\n**Common mistakes**\nLearners often assume a south-facing roof is always perfect. It is not perfect if a large tree shades it or if the rafters are too weak to hold the panels. Always check all three: Orientation, Shading, and Structure.\n\nMisconceptions (targeted):\n*   *Misconception:* Any south-facing roof is perfect for solar. | *Correction:* It must also be unshaded and structurally sound.\n*   *Misconception:* Planning permission is never needed for small units. | *Correction:* Height limits (e.g., turbine masts) or listed building status can trigger legal constraints."

        "title": "Evaluating System Performance",
        "content": "### In this lesson\nThis lesson covers how to compare different micro-renewable technologies based on their efficiency and physical limitations.\n\n**What this is**\nEvaluating performance involves checking how efficiently a system converts energy. For heat pumps, we use the **Coefficient of Performance (COP)**. \n\n**The \"Buy One, Get Free\" Analogy:**\nThink of COP as a deal at a shop. A COP of 3.0 is like \"Buy 1, Get 2 Free.\" You pay for 1 unit of electricity, and the system gives you 3 units of heat (1 paid + 2 free from the environment). The higher the COP, the better the deal.\n\n**Key facts / rules**\n*   **COP vs. Seasonal Efficiency:** COP is a **snapshot** of performance at a specific moment (e.g., on a mild day). **Seasonal Efficiency** is the average performance over a whole year. Do not confuse them. A system might have a great COP today but a poor average over winter.\n*   **Solar PV:** Major advantage is **no moving parts**, meaning very low maintenance. Disadvantage: Works only during daylight.\n*   **Wind Turbines:** Advantage: Can work at night. Disadvantage: Moving parts require maintenance, and they can be noisy.\n*   **Intermittency:** Most renewables are intermittent—they don't generate power 24/7.\n\n**How to do it**\n1.  **Calculate COP:** Divide Heat Output by Electrical Input. (e.g., 12kW heat / 3kW input = COP 4).\n2.  **Compare Features:** Weigh technical advantages (e.g., low maintenance of PV) against site disadvantages (e.g., north-facing roof).\n3.  **Check Environment:** A heat pump's COP drops when it is very cold outside. Always check if the local climate supports the technology.\n\n**Common mistakes**\nAssuming a high COP at installation guarantees low bills forever. It doesn't. If the average annual temperature is very low, the *Seasonal Efficiency* will be lower than the tested COP.\n\nMisconceptions (targeted):\n*   *Misconception:* A system with a high COP is always cheapest to run. | *Correction:* COP fluctuates with weather; seasonal efficiency is the better predictor of annual cost.\n*   *Misconception:* Solar panels are always best because they have no moving parts. | *Correction:* They are low maintenance, but useless if the site has no sun."
