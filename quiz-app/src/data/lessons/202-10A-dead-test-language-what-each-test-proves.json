        "content": "Before we ever turn on the power to a new installation, we must prove it is safe. We do this through **dead testing**. To do this effectively, you must understand the &quot;logic&quot; of each test—what exactly are we trying to prove?\n\n1. **Continuity: The &apos;Should be Connected&apos; Test**\nContinuity proves that a conductor is unbroken from one end to the other. If we are testing a ring final circuit or a protective earth wire, we want to know that the copper path is complete. \n- **The Question:** Is the path unbroken?\n- **The Unit:** Ohms (Ω).\n- **The Goal:** A **low** reading (e.g., 0.2 Ω). A high reading suggests a loose connection or a broken wire.\n\n2. **Insulation Resistance (IR): The &apos;Must Not be Connected&apos; Test**\nWhile continuity checks that the copper is good, IR checks that the plastic (insulation) surrounding the copper is doing its job. We want to ensure that electricity cannot &quot;leak&quot; from the Line conductor into the Neutral or the Earth wire.\n- **The Question:** Is the insulation preventing leaks?\n- **The Unit:** Megaohms (MΩ).\n- **The Goal:** A **very high** reading (e.g., >299 MΩ or at least >1 MΩ). A low reading (like 0.02 MΩ) means the insulation is damaged and current is leaking.\n\n3. **Polarity: The &apos;Right Place&apos; Test**\nPolarity isn&apos;t about a specific number; it&apos;s about identity. We need to ensure that the Line conductor goes to the fuse, the circuit breaker, and the switch—not the Neutral. If a switch is on the Neutral wire, the appliance might look &quot;off,&quot; but the internal parts remain live and dangerous.\n- **The Question:** Is the Line conductor in the correct terminal?\n- **The Goal:** Confirmation that the switch or fuse is in the Line path.\n\n**Measurement vs. Conclusion**\nAs an electrician, you must distinguish between the **measurement** (the number on the screen) and the **conclusion** (what that number means). A reading of 0.05 Ω is just a number. Your conclusion is: &quot;This is a pass for continuity because it is a low resistance path.&quot; Conversely, 0.05 MΩ is a &quot;fail&quot; for insulation resistance because it indicates a dangerous short circuit."
