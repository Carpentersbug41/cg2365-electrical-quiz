        "title": "Managing Test Leads and Accuracy",
        "content": "In electrical testing, particularly when measuring low resistances like continuity, the equipment you use can actually interfere with the result. Every set of test leads has its own internal resistance, usually between **0.1Ω and 0.5Ω**. While this seems small, it is significant when the circuit you are testing is also expected to be very low. If you do not account for this, you may record a &quot;fail&quot; result for a circuit that is actually perfectly healthy.\n\n**Common Lead Problems**\nBefore testing, always inspect your leads. Problems that distort readings include:\n1. **Damaged Insulation**: Can cause intermittent shorts or safety hazards.\n2. **Loose Probes**: If the wire is pulling out of the probe handle, resistance will fluctuate.\n3. **Broken Internal Conductors**: Leads that work only when held at a certain angle.\n4. **Contamination**: Dirt or oxidation on the probe tips increases contact resistance.\n\n**The Purpose of Nulling**\nNulling (or zeroing) is the process of compensating for lead resistance. By touching the probe tips firmly together and pressing the &quot;Null&quot; or &quot;Zero&quot; button, the meter subtracts that lead resistance from all future readings. If your leads measure 0.20Ω and you null them, the meter will display 0.00Ω. If you then test a circuit and it reads 0.50Ω, you know that is the **actual** resistance of the wiring, not the wiring plus the leads.\n\n**Avoiding False Readings**\nFalse readings often come from &quot;jumpy&quot; or unstable displays. To avoid this, use firm probing techniques. Ensure you are touching clean metal, not paint or plastic insulation. Avoid touching the metal tips of the probes with your fingers, as your body resistance can create a parallel path and change the result, especially during high-resistance tests like Insulation Resistance.\n\n**What to do when readings look wrong**\nIf a reading seems impossible (e.g., a massive resistance on a short wire), do not just write it down. Stop and check your setup. Re-null your leads, check your battery level, and ensure you are on the correct setting. Always **re-prove** your tester if you suspect the leads have failed during the process."
