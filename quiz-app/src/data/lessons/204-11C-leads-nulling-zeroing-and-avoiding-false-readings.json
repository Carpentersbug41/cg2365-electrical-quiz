        "content": "In low-ohms testing (continuity), tiny setup issues can change the number you see. That’s because your tester is measuring **everything in the path** between the probes — including **lead resistance** and **contact resistance** at the probe tips.\n\n### Why lead resistance matters (continuity)\nWhen a circuit path is expected to be **very low resistance**, the resistance of your leads and probe contacts can become a noticeable part of the result. If you ignore that, you can record a reading that looks “too high” even when the circuit is fine.\n\n### Common lead and contact problems (what causes jumpy/high readings)\nBefore you blame the circuit, check these:\n1. **Poor probe contact**: touching paint, oxidation, or a loose screw instead of clean metal.\n2. **Dirty/oxidised probe tips**: increases contact resistance and causes flicker.\n3. **Loose probe connections**: probes not fully seated; leads not fully inserted.\n4. **Internal lead damage**: readings change when you move the lead.\n5. **Wrong ports / wrong function**: meter set incorrectly so the result is meaningless.\n\n### What nulling/zeroing does\nNulling is how you tell the meter: “Ignore the resistance of my leads for low-ohms work.”\n- You apply the probes to a **known low-resistance condition** (e.g., probe tips together or an approved proving point).\n- You activate **Null/Zero** (where available).\n- After nulling, the meter compensates so future low-ohms readings reflect the circuit more accurately.\n\n### Probing technique (how to stop false readings)\n- Make **firm, stable contact** on clean metal.\n- Keep probes **still** while the reading stabilises.\n- Don’t “scrape around” searching for a point — choose the correct test point first (use your circuit map).\n- Keep fingers off probe metal (especially important for high-resistance tests).\n\n### What to do when a reading looks wrong (the reliability ladder)\nIf a result looks wrong in principle (unexpectedly high, unstable, or inconsistent), don’t record it yet. Use this routine:\n1. **Stop** and hold probes still.\n2. **Stabilise contact** (clean metal contact, firm pressure, correct test points).\n3. **Check setup** (correct ports + correct function/range).\n4. **Null/Zero** (if doing low-ohms continuity work and your meter supports it).\n5. **Re-prove → re-test** (apply Prove → Test → Re-prove logic before concluding the circuit is at fault)."
