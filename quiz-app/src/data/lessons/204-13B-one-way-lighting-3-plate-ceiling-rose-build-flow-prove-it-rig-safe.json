        "title": "The Systematic Build Flow",
        "content": "To ensure a safe and professional installation, every electrician follows a repeatable **build flow**. This prevents errors and ensures the circuit is 'rig-safe' before any testing begins.\n\n1. **Step 0 — Rig-safe start**: Confirm the training rig is isolated and in an approved dead state. Never start work until your workspace is clear and the correct circuit is identified.\n\n2. **Step 1 — Plan from the diagram**: Before touching any cable, you must visualize the 'wire journey'. Identify where the **Loop (permanent live)** group is, which conductor is the **switch feed**, and which is the **switch return**. If you cannot explain the path of the electricity, do not start the build.\n\n3. **Step 2 — Mount accessories**: Secure the consumer unit, switch box, and ceiling rose. Mechanical integrity is vital; accessories must be square and secure so that covers fit without crushing wires.\n\n4. **Step 3 — Route and prepare cables**: Bring the cable **sheath into the accessories** to ensure no single-insulated cores are exposed. Apply identification immediately: **Green/Yellow sleeving** for CPCs and **Brown sleeving** for any conductor used as a live (especially the switch return).\n\n5. **Step 4 — Terminate**: Follow the specific 3-plate map. The **Loop group** holds the CU Line and the Switch Feed. The **Neutral group** holds the CU Neutral and the Lamp Neutral. The **Switched Live group** holds the Switch Return and the Lamp Live. Finally, ensure the **CPC** is continuous and terminated at every point, including the switch box.\n\n6. **Step 5 — Dead inspection**: Perform a visual check. Are there loose terminations? Is there copper showing outside terminals? Is the ID sleeving correct? Only proceed to testing if the inspection passes."
