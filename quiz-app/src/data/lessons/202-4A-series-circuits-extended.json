          "title": "The 3 Parallel Rules (and why they’re true)",
          "content": "**Rule 1 (Voltage):** Voltage is the same across each branch in a parallel circuit.\n\n**Rule 2 (Current):** Total current is shared between branches. Branch currents add up to the total current.\n\n**Rule 3 (Resistance):** Total resistance is **lower** than the smallest branch resistance. For two resistors in parallel:\n\n- **1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2**\n\n---\n\n### Why these rules work (diagram-anchored)\nLook at the diagram: both branches connect to the **same two junctions** — `junctionA` and `junctionB`.\n\n- **Voltage (V):** Voltage is the potential difference between two points. Because each branch starts at `junctionA` and ends at `junctionB`, each branch has the **same two points**, so each branch has the **same voltage**.\n\n- **Current (I):** At `junctionA`, current has a choice of paths. It **splits** into branch currents and then **rejoins** at `junctionB`. That’s why:\n  - **I_total = I1 + I2 (+ ...)**\n\n- **Resistance (R):** Adding branches gives current **more paths**. More paths makes it easier for current to flow overall, so total resistance **goes down**.\n\n---\n\n### Sanity checks (use these to catch mistakes)\n- **V_branch = V_supply** (each branch is across the same two junctions)\n- **R_total < smallest resistor** (parallel always lowers total resistance)\n\n---\n\n### One-line summary (memorise this)\n**Parallel:** **V same** • **I splits (adds up)** • **R uses 1/R (R_total < smallest)**"
