        "title": "Understanding AC Voltage Measurements",
        "content": "When we measure AC, we can describe the voltage in **several different ways**. Each measurement tells us something different about the waveform.\n\n**Why Multiple Measurements?**\nUnlike DC (which has one steady voltage), AC constantly changes. We need different ways to describe its behavior:\n- How high does it go? (peak)\n- How much does it vary? (peak-to-peak)\n- What's the effective power? (RMS)\n- How long is one cycle? (period)\n\n**The Most Important: RMS**\n**RMS (Root Mean Square)** is the most useful measurement because it tells us the **effective value** — the voltage that produces the same heating/power effect as DC.\n\n- When we say \"UK mains is 230V\", we mean **230V RMS**\n- RMS is what multimeters show (in AC mode)\n- RMS is what equipment ratings use\n- Formula: **RMS = 0.707 × peak** (you don't need to calculate this at Level 2)\n\n**Peak Voltage**\nThe **peak** is the maximum voltage reached in one direction.\n\n- UK mains: **325V peak** (even though we call it \"230V\")\n- Peak = 1.414 × RMS\n- Important for insulation ratings and safety clearances\n- Capacitors need peak voltage ratings, not RMS\n\n**Peak-to-Peak Voltage**\nThe **peak-to-peak** is the total voltage swing from top to bottom.\n\n- Peak-to-peak = 2 × peak\n- UK mains: 650V peak-to-peak (325V positive to 325V negative)\n- Useful for oscilloscope measurements\n- Shows the full range of voltage variation"

        "content": "AC sine waves repeat in a regular pattern. We can measure this repetition in two ways: **period** (time) or **frequency** (cycles per second).\n\n**Period (T)**\nThe **period** is the time taken for **one complete cycle**.\n\n- Symbol: T\n- Units: seconds (s), often milliseconds (ms)\n- UK mains: **T = 0.02 seconds = 20 ms**\n- One cycle = positive peak → zero → negative peak → zero → back to start\n\n**Frequency (f)**\nThe **frequency** is the number of cycles per second.\n\n- Symbol: f\n- Units: hertz (Hz)\n- UK mains: **f = 50 Hz** (50 cycles per second)\n- Already covered in lesson 202-7A\n\n**The Relationship: Period and Frequency**\nPeriod and frequency are **inversely related** — when one goes up, the other goes down.\n\n**Formula:** **T = 1/f** (period = 1 divided by frequency)\n\n**Examples:**\n- 50 Hz → T = 1/50 = 0.02 s (20 ms)\n- 60 Hz → T = 1/60 = 0.0167 s (16.7 ms)\n- 1000 Hz (1 kHz) → T = 1/1000 = 0.001 s (1 ms)\n\n**At Level 2, you should know:**\n- UK mains is 50 Hz (frequency)\n- One cycle takes 20 ms (period)\n- T = 1/f (the relationship)\n\n**You don't need to calculate periods for unusual frequencies at this level.**"

        "title": "Average Voltage: Why It's Zero",
        "content": "**What is Average Voltage?**\nThe **average voltage** is the mathematical average over one complete cycle. For a pure sine wave, this average is **zero**.\n\n**Why Zero?**\nA symmetrical AC waveform spends equal time positive and negative:\n- First half of cycle: voltage is **positive** (e.g., +325V down to 0V)\n- Second half of cycle: voltage is **negative** (e.g., 0V down to -325V)\n- The positive and negative halves **cancel out exactly**\n- Mathematical average = 0V\n\n**But AC Clearly Does Work!**\nThis seems confusing — if the average is zero, how does AC power anything?\n\n**The answer: Power depends on RMS, not average.**\n- Current and voltage are both reversing together\n- Power = V × I, and this is always positive (both forward, or both backward)\n- The **heating effect** doesn't cancel out\n- That's why we use RMS, not average, for AC power\n\n**Average Voltage for Rectified AC**\nIf you convert AC to DC (using a rectifier), you get a **pulsating DC** that's always positive. Now the average is **not zero** — it's about 0.637 × peak.\n\n**At Level 2:**\n- Know that average voltage for pure AC = 0V\n- Understand this is because positive cancels negative\n- Recognize that RMS is the useful value, not average\n- You don't need to calculate average values\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Measurement | UK Mains Example | When Used |\n|-------------|------------------|----------|\n| **RMS** | 230V | Equipment ratings, power calculations |\n| **Peak** | 325V | Insulation ratings, capacitor voltage |\n| **Peak-to-Peak** | 650V | Oscilloscope measurements |\n| **Average** | 0V | (Not useful for pure AC) |\n| **Period** | 20 ms | Timing calculations |\n| **Frequency** | 50 Hz | Standard specification |"
