Each measurement tells us something different about the waveform.\n\n**Why Multiple Measurements?**\nUnlike DC (which has one steady voltage), AC constantly changes. We need different ways to describe its behavior:\n- How high does it go? (peak)\n- How much does it vary? (peak-to-peak)\n- What's the effective power? (RMS)\n- How long is one cycle? (period)\n\n**The Most Important: RMS**\n**RMS (Root Mean Square)** is the most useful measurement because it tells us the **effective value** — the voltage that produces the same heating/power effect as DC.\n\n- When we say \"UK mains is 230V\", we mean **230V RMS**\n- RMS is what multimeters show (in AC mode)\n- RMS is what equipment ratings use\n- Formula: **RMS = 0.707 × peak** (you don't need to calculate this at Level 2)\n\n**Peak Voltage**\nThe **peak** is the maximum voltage reached in one direction.\n\n- UK mains: **325V peak** (even though we call it \"230V\")\n- Peak = 1.414 × RMS\n- Important for insulation ratings and safety clearances\n- Capacitors need peak voltage ratings, not RMS\n\n**Peak-to-Peak Voltage**\nThe **peak-to-peak** is the total voltage swing from top to bottom.\n\n- Peak-to-peak = 2 × peak\n- UK mains: 650V peak-to-peak (325V positive to 325V negative)\n- Useful for oscilloscope measurements\n- Shows the full range of voltage variation"

Now the average is **not zero** — it's about 0.637 × peak.\n\n**At Level 2:**\n- Know that average voltage for pure AC = 0V\n- Understand this is because positive cancels negative\n- Recognize that RMS is the useful value, not average\n- You don't need to calculate average values\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Measurement | UK Mains Example | When Used |\n|-------------|------------------|----------|\n| **RMS** | 230V | Equipment ratings, power calculations |\n| **Peak** | 325V | Insulation ratings, capacitor voltage |\n| **Peak-to-Peak** | 650V | Oscilloscope measurements |\n| **Average** | 0V | (Not useful for pure AC) |\n| **Period** | 20 ms | Timing calculations |\n| **Frequency** | 50 Hz | Standard specification |"

RMS (230V) is used for power calculations and equipment ratings because it gives the effective value. Peak (325V) is used for insulation ratings and capacitor selection because components must handle the maximum voltage. Period and frequency (20ms, 50Hz) are used for timing calculations and generator speed. Average (0V) isn't useful for pure AC but matters after rectification.
