        "title": "The Four Fundamental Electrical Quantities",
        "content": "In electrical work, we use four main quantities to describe what's happening in a circuit:\n\n**1. Current (I)** — measured in **amperes (A)**\nCurrent is the flow of electric charge through a conductor. Think of it like water flowing through a pipe — the more charge flowing per second, the higher the current.\n\n**2. Voltage (V)** — measured in **volts (V)**\nVoltage is the electrical 'pressure' or potential difference that pushes current through a circuit. Like water pressure in a pipe system, higher voltage means more 'push'.\n\n**3. Resistance (R)** — measured in **ohms (Ω)**\nResistance is the opposition to current flow. Materials with high resistance (like rubber) don't allow current to flow easily. Materials with low resistance (like copper wire) allow current to flow easily.\n\n**4. Power (P)** — measured in **watts (W)**\nPower is the rate at which electrical energy is being used or transferred. A 100W light bulb uses energy faster than a 60W bulb.\n\n**Remember the units:**\n- **A** for amperes (current)\n- **V** for volts (voltage)  \n- **Ω** for ohms (resistance)\n- **W** for watts (power)"
