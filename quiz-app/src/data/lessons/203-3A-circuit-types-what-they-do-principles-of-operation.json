        "title": "The Main Circuit Types and Principles",
        "content": "**What this is**\nIn any electrical installation, circuits are categorized by their **function** and sometimes by their **arrangement**. These categories (“circuit types”) help you quickly understand what a circuit is intended to supply and how it is routed from the protective device to the load(s).\n\n**Why it matters**\nElectricians must recognize circuit types so they can:\n- Apply the correct safety approach and safe isolation planning\n- Choose suitable materials and protective devices (later in the unit)\n- Use the correct inspection/testing approach (rings vs radials are different)\n\n**Key rules / facts (simple)**\n- **Lighting circuits:** supply fixed lighting points. Usually multiple light points, controlled by one or more switches.\n- **Power circuits (socket circuits):** supply socket outlets for portable equipment. Often arranged as either **Ring Final** or **Radial**.\n- **Heating circuits:** supply fixed, higher-power loads (e.g., shower, immersion, fixed heaters). Often **dedicated** (one appliance on its own circuit) because current can be high for long periods.\n- **Alarm & emergency systems:** supply safety-related equipment (e.g., fire alarm, emergency lighting). These are often kept separate from general power/lighting to **reduce the chance** that a fault on general circuits affects safety equipment (exact design varies).\n- **Data communications:** carry low-voltage signals (internet/phone/control data), not mains power. Kept away from power cables where practical to reduce interference.\n- **Control circuits:** send “commands” (e.g., thermostat signal, contactor coil control). Often lower voltage than the power circuit it controls.\n\n**Ring vs Radial (the physical difference)**\n- **Ring final:** leaves the protective device and **returns to the same device** (a loop).\n- **Radial:** leaves the protective device and **ends at the last outlet** (a line).\n\n**How to classify a circuit (repeatable method)**\n1) **Identify the load**: what is it supplying?\n2) **Check the arrangement**: ring (out-and-back) or radial (out-and-stop) when it’s a socket/power circuit.\n3) **Confirm using documentation**: check the **legend** and/or **schedule of circuitry** on the drawing, or the circuit schedule/labels on the distribution board.\n\n**Common mistakes**\n- Confusing **circuit type** (what it does) with **wiring system** (how it’s installed, e.g., conduit/trunking).\n- Assuming all socket circuits are rings (many are radials).\n- Thinking data circuits carry 230V (they carry signals).\n\n**Quick recap**\n- Circuit types = grouped by purpose (lighting, power, heating, etc.).\n- Rings loop back; radials end at the last point.\n- Confirm labels using the legend/schedule—don’t guess."

        "title": "Common Traps (Read This Before Practice)",
        "content": "- **Trap 1: “Power circuit” automatically means ring.** Nope. Power circuits can be ring final or radial.\n- **Trap 2: Mixing up purpose vs containment.** “Lighting circuit” is purpose; “conduit” is containment (wiring system).\n- **Trap 3: Guessing labels.** Labels vary. Always confirm using the **legend** or **schedule of circuitry**.\n- **Trap 4: Data = mains power.** Data circuits are signals. They’re not there to run kettles.\n\nIf you follow the 3-rule method (load → arrangement → confirm), you avoid nearly all beginner mistakes."
