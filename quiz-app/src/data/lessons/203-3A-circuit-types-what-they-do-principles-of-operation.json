        "content": "**What this is**\nIn electrical installations, circuits are grouped into specific types based on what they supply (the load) and how the cables are physically arranged. A &quot;principle of operation&quot; describes what the circuit is for and how it functions as a system.\n\n**Why it matters**\nRecognising circuit types is the first step in installation work. Different types have different rules for cable sizing, protective devices, and testing. If you cannot identify the circuit type, you cannot safely maintain or install it.\n\n**Key rules / facts**\n*   **Circuit type:** A category based on what a circuit is for and/or how it is arranged (e.g., lighting, sockets, alarms).\n*   **Lighting circuits:** Supply multiple light points (ceiling/wall), usually low-power, controlled by switches.\n*   **Power circuits:** Supply socket outlets for portable appliances. These can be **Ring Final** (loop back to source) or **Radial** (straight line ending at the last point).\n*   **Heating circuits:** Dedicated circuits for fixed, high-power loads like electric showers, immersion heaters, or cookers.\n*   **Alarm & Emergency systems:** Separate circuits for fire alarms and emergency lighting to ensure reliability and safety.\n*   **Data communications:** Circuits that carry signals (like Ethernet), not mains power. They must be kept away from interference.\n*   **Control circuits:** Used to send signals to switch equipment on or off (e.g., a thermostat controlling a boiler).\n\n**How to use it**\nWhen identifying a circuit:\n1. Check the load (What is it plugged into?)\n2. Check the arrangement (Does it loop back or end in a line?)\n3. Check the purpose (Is it for power, safety, or control?)\n\n**Common mistakes**\n*   Confusing &quot;circuit type&quot; (what it does) with &quot;wiring system&quot; (how it is contained, like conduit).\n*   Assuming data circuits carry mains voltage.\n*   Thinking a control circuit always carries the full power of the load it switches.\n\n**Quick recap**\n*   Ring circuits go &quot;out and back&quot; to the same protective device.\n*   Radial circuits go &quot;out and end&quot; at the last point.\n*   Safety systems (alarms) are kept separate for reliability."
