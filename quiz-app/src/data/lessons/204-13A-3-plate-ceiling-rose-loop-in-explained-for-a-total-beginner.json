        "content": "Safety note (training rig only): This lesson is for conceptual learning. Never open or work on real ceiling roses unless you are trained/supervised and the circuit is safely isolated and proven dead.\n\n## 1) What is a ceiling rose?\nIf you’ve never seen one: a ceiling rose is **two things in one**.\n- A **junction point** where several cables join together.\n- The **connection point** for the lamp holder (the light).\n\nThat’s why a rose can look crowded: it’s not just ‘a light connector’ — it’s also where the circuit continues.\n\n## 2) What “loop-in” means (plain English)\nMany lighting circuits go: Consumer unit → Light 1 → Light 2 → Light 3 …\n\n**Loop-in** means the main supply is joined at each ceiling rose and then continues (‘loops’) onward to the next light point.\n\nAt a typical rose in the middle of a run, you often see:\n- a cable bringing supply **in**\n- a cable taking supply **out** to the next light\n- a cable going to the switch (the **switch drop**)\n- the lamp flex (to the lamp holder)\n\n## 3) The three terminal groups (three “buckets”)\nA 3-plate rose is easiest if you imagine **three labelled buckets**. Each conductor must go in the correct bucket.\n\n### Plate A — Neutrals group\nThis group is for **all neutrals joined together**.\nTypical roles you’ll see joined here:\n- Neutral from supply **in**\n- Neutral to supply **out** (if there is a next light)\n- Lamp neutral (from lamp flex)\n\nNeutral is normally **not switched** in a standard 1-way lighting circuit.\n\n### Plate B — Permanent lives (loop) group\nThis group is for the lives that are **permanently live when the circuit is energised**.\nTypical roles you’ll see joined here:\n- Live from supply **in**\n- Live to supply **out** (if there is a next light)\n- Live feed **to the switch** (down the switch drop)\n\nThis is why it’s called the **loop** group: it keeps the supply ‘looping’ through the lighting circuit and feeds the switch.\n\n### Plate C — Switched live group\nThis group is for the live that comes **back from the switch**.\nTypical roles you’ll see joined here:\n- Switched live return (from the switch drop)\n- Lamp live (from lamp flex)\n\nThis group is only live when the switch is **ON**.\n\n## 4) The switch (simple mental picture)\nA 1-way switch is like a bridge in the live path.\n- One conductor takes a **permanent live feed down** to the switch.\n- One conductor brings a **switched live back** to the lamp.\n\nSo the lamp only gets power when the switch ‘connects’ the feed to the return.\n\n## 5) Tiny colour anchor (don’t rely on colour alone)\nModern colours you often see on training rigs:\n- **Blue = Neutral** (goes to the Neutral group)\n- **Brown = Live** (permanent live or switched live depending on role)\n- **Green/Yellow = CPC (Earth)**\n\nImportant: colours help, but **identification and correct grouping** is what matters. In real work, always follow safe systems and correct identification practices."
