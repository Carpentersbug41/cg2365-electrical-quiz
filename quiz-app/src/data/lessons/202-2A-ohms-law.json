        "content": "**Ohm's Law** is one of the most important principles in electrical work. It describes the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in any circuit.\n\n**The Formula:**\n\n**V = I × R**\n\nWhere:\n- **V** = Voltage in volts (V)\n- **I** = Current in amperes (A)\n- **R** = Resistance in ohms (Ω)\n\n**What It Means:**\n\nOhm's Law tells us that the voltage across a component equals the current flowing through it multiplied by its resistance.\n\n**Think of it like water in a pipe:**\n- **Voltage (V)** is like water pressure - the push that makes water flow\n- **Current (I)** is like the flow rate - how much water flows per second\n- **Resistance (R)** is like the pipe width - narrow pipes resist flow more\n\nHigher pressure (voltage) creates more flow (current). A narrower pipe (higher resistance) reduces flow (current).\n\n**The Three Forms:**\n\nWe can rearrange Ohm's Law to solve for any variable:\n\n1. **V = I × R** (to find voltage)\n2. **I = V ÷ R** (to find current)\n3. **R = V ÷ I** (to find resistance)\n\n**How They Relate:**\n\n- If you **increase voltage**, current increases (V and I are directly proportional)\n- If you **increase resistance**, current decreases (I and R are inversely proportional)\n- Voltage is the product of current and resistance\n\nRemember: You need to know **any two** values to calculate the third!"
