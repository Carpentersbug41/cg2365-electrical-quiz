        "title": "Understanding the Switch Drop (feed down + return up)",
        "content": "In a standard 3-plate ceiling rose circuit, the switch acts as a simple bridge. Its job is to break or complete the **live** path. The live conductor travels down to the switch and back up again — that down-and-up journey is the **switch drop**.\n\n### The bucket model (rose terminal groups)\nThink of the ceiling rose as three labelled buckets:\n- **Neutral group:** supply neutral + lamp neutral (neutral is not switched).\n- **Loop group (permanent live):** supply live and any permanent live links/feeds.\n- **Switched live group:** the switched live return and the lamp live.\n\n### 1) Feed down (Loop → COM)\nA conductor from the **Loop group** feeds permanent live down the switch drop and terminates at **COM**.\n\n### 2) Return up (L1 → Switched live group → lamp live)\nWhen the switch is ON, it connects **COM to L1**. The conductor on **L1** becomes the switched live return and travels back up the switch drop to the ceiling rose. It terminates in the **Switched live group**, which feeds the lamp live.\n\n### 3) Neutral stays at the rose (not on the switch)\nNeutral remains in the **Neutral group** at the ceiling rose. In this classic method, neutral does not need to go to the switch.\n\n### 4) CPC goes to the switch point (even if the switch is plastic)\nThe CPC must be continuous through the circuit and must be terminated at the ceiling rose and at the switch point (earth terminal/connector), even with plastic accessories.\n\n### Identification / sleeving rule (non-negotiable)\nIn a switch drop, cores can be misleading (for example, a blue core used in a live role). **Any core used as live must be identified as live (brown) at terminations.** This includes the switched live return and any other core carrying live in that drop.\n\n### Quick dead inspection before any meter work\nBefore testing, visually confirm:\n- No exposed copper outside terminals.\n- No ‘plastic-in’ (insulation clamped instead of copper).\n- Terminations are firm (gentle tug test).\n- CPC present and terminated at rose and switch point.\n- Brown identification present where required."
