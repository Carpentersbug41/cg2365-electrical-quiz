        "content": "Safety note (rig-safe): This lesson is for conceptual learning on training rigs. Never open or work on real ceiling roses/switches unless the circuit is safely isolated, proven dead, and you are trained/supervised.\n\nIn a standard 3-plate ceiling rose circuit, the switch acts like a simple bridge. Its job is to break or complete the **live** path. The live conductor travels down to the switch and back up again — that down-and-up journey is the **switch drop**.\n\n### The bucket model (rose terminal groups)\nThink of the ceiling rose as three labelled buckets:\n- **Neutral group:** supply neutral + lamp neutral (neutral is not switched).\n- **Loop group (permanent live):** supply live and any permanent live links/feeds (this group stays live when the circuit is energised, even if the switch is OFF).\n- **Switched live group:** the switched live return and the lamp live (this group is only live when the switch is ON).\n\n### The live journey (the story you must be able to say out loud)\n**Loop group → COM → L1 → Switched live group → lamp live**\n\n### Micro “core role map” (ultra-beginner)\nIn many training setups, the switch drop cable has **two insulated cores + CPC**.\n\n**At the switch:**\n- **COM = the feed down (permanent live from the rose Loop group)**\n- **L1 = the return up (switched live back to the rose Switched live group)**\n\n**At the rose:**\n- The **feed-down core** belongs in the **Loop group** (because it is permanent live feeding the switch)\n- The **return-up core** belongs in the **Switched live group** (because it becomes live only when the switch is ON)\n\n### Identification / sleeving rule (non-negotiable)\nIn a switch drop, a core colour can be misleading (for example, a blue core used as the switched live return). **Any core used as live must be identified as live (brown) at BOTH ends (both terminations).**\n\n### CPC rule (also non-negotiable)\nThe CPC must be continuous through the circuit and must be terminated at the ceiling rose and at the switch point (earth terminal/connector), even with plastic accessories.\n\n### Quick dead inspection checklist (before any meter work)\nTick these off visually (and with a gentle tug check) before testing:\n- No exposed copper outside terminals\n- No “plastic-in” (insulation clamped instead of copper)\n- Correct terminals used (Loop group vs Switched live group; COM vs L1)\n- Brown identification present where a core is used as live (at both ends)\n- CPC present and terminated at rose and at switch point\n- Terminations are firm (gentle tug test)"
