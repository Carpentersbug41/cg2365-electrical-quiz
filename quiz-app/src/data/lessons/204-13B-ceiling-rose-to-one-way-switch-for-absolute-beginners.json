        "title": "Understanding the Switch Drop",
        "content": "In a standard 3-plate lighting circuit, the switch acts as a simple **bridge**. It does not need a Neutral wire to function; its only job is to break or complete the path of the **Live** conductor. This journey of the live wire from the ceiling rose down to the switch and back up is called the **switch drop**.\n\nTo understand this, we use the **Bucket Model**. Imagine the ceiling rose has three separate buckets for wires. The **Neutral bucket** holds the supply neutral and the lamp neutral. The **Loop bucket** holds the permanent live from the supply. The **Switched Live bucket** holds the wire that goes directly to the lamp live terminal. \n\n1. **The Feed Down:** We take a wire from the **Loop bucket** (permanent live) and send it down the switch drop cable to the switch. This wire must land in the **COM (Common)** terminal. This terminal is now 'waiting' with live power.\n\n2. **The Return Back:** We connect a second wire to the **L1** terminal of the switch. This wire travels back up the switch drop cable to the ceiling rose and lands in the **Switched Live bucket**. \n\n3. **Completing the Circuit:** Inside the rose, the lamp's live wire is already sitting in the Switched Live bucket. When you flick the switch, COM and L1 connect, allowing the live power to flow from the Loop, through the switch, into the Switched Live bucket, and finally into the lamp.\n\n**Safety and Identification:** Because we often use a standard twin-and-earth cable for the switch drop, one of the cores might be blue. However, in a switch drop, **both cores are carrying live voltage**. You must place **brown sleeving** over the blue core at both ends (the rose and the switch) to warn future electricians that this wire is a 'Switched Live' and not a Neutral.\n\n**Dead Inspection:** Before turning the power on, always perform a visual check. Ensure there is **no exposed copper** outside the terminals, check that no insulation is trapped inside the terminal (plastic-in), and perform a gentle **tug test** to ensure every wire is tight. Most importantly, ensure the **CPC (Earth)** is connected to the earth terminal in both the rose and the switch box, even if the switch itself is plastic."
