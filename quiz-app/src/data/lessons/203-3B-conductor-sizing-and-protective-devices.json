        "content": "### Circuit Types (AC1)\nEvery installation uses specific circuit layouts depending on the load:\n*   **Radial Circuits:** These run from the source to the points of use and stop. They are simple and used for most lighting and heavy fixed appliances (like a cooker).\n*   **Ring Final Circuits:** These form a loop. Because the current has two paths to travel, you can use thinner conductors for the same total load. These are unique to UK-style socket outlets.\n\n### Protective Devices (AC4)\nProtective devices like **MCBs (Miniature Circuit Breakers)** and **Fuses** protect the cable from **Overcurrent** (heat damage). \n\n**Standard Ratings ($I_n$):** To prevent the device from tripping during normal use, the rating ($I_n$) must be equal to or greater than the load ($I_b$). Standard commercial ratings you will often select from include: **6A, 10A, 16A, 20A, 25A, 32A, and 40A.**\n\n**The Golden Rule:** $I_n \\ge I_b$. \n*Example:* If your load ($I_b$) is 14A, you cannot use a 10A breaker (it would trip). You would select the next standard size: **16A**.\n\n### Why it matters\nIf you use a radial circuit for a high-power area without the right protection, the cable could melt before the fuse blows. The device must be the 'weak link' that breaks first to save the building from fire."
