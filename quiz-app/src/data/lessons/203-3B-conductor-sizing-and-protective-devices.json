        "content": "### Circuit Types (AC1)\nThere are two main ways we wire power circuits:\n*   **Radial Circuits:** The cable leaves the consumer unit and goes to the first point, then the second, and ends at the last point. It is simple but the voltage drops more at the far end.\n*   **Ring Final Circuits:** The cable leaves the consumer unit, visits every socket, and **returns** to the same terminal in the consumer unit. This creates a loop. \n*   **Concrete Anchor:** Think of a Radial circuit like a dead-end road; a Ring Final is like a circular race track where cars (current) can go both ways to reach a destination.\n\n### Protective Devices (AC4)\nTo keep these circuits safe, we use protective devices to act as the 'weak link' that breaks the circuit if there is too much current.\n*   **MCB (Miniature Circuit Breaker):** An electromechanical switch that 'trips' (flips off) when it detects an overload or a short circuit. It can be reset.\n*   **Fuse:** A sacrificial wire that melts when too much current flows. Once it 'blows,' it must be replaced.\n*   **Application:** MCBs are standard in modern consumer units for easy resetting. Fuses are often found in plugs or older industrial switchgear.\n\n### The Golden Rule\nThe **Nominal Rating (In)** of the device must be equal to or greater than the **Design Current (Ib)** of the load. If you have a 13A load, you cannot use a 10A fuse; it would blow immediately. You would use a 15A or 16A device instead."

Used for underground runs or outdoors where it might be hit by a spade or crushed.\n\n### Conductor Sizing (AC3)\n**Current-Carrying Capacity (Iz)** is the maximum current a cable can handle before its insulation melts. This capacity changes based on the environment. We use **Correction Factors (CF)** to adjust the rating.\n\n**The Calculation Formula:**\nTo find the minimum required capacity (**Iz**), we take the protective device rating (**In**) and divide it by the correction factors:\n**Iz ≥ In / (Factors)**\n\n**Common Factors:**\n*   **Ca (Ambient Temperature):** If the room is hot, the cable can't shed heat easily.\n*   **Cg (Grouping):** If many cables are bunched together, they heat each other up.\n*   **Ci (Thermal Insulation):** If a cable is buried in loft insulation, the heat is trapped.\n\n**Micro-scenario:** If you put a heater (cable) under a thick duvet (insulation), it gets much hotter.

              "A radial circuit is a single line from the source to the loads, whereas a ring final circuit is a loop that returns to the source. A ring is often preferred for high-power areas because the current splits and flows in two directions, allowing the circuit to support a higher total load (up to 32A) while using relatively thin, flexible 2.5mm cables."

Next, a protective device is selected with a nominal rating (In) that is equal to or greater than Ib. Then, environmental factors like temperature or grouping are identified as correction factors. Finally, the required current-carrying capacity (Iz) is calculated by dividing In by these factors, and a cable is chosen that meets this Iz value."
