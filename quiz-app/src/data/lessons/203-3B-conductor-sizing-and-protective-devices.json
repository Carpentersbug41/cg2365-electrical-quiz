        "content": "### Circuit Arrangements\nIn electrical installations, we arrange cables in specific patterns called circuit types. The two most common are **Radial** and **Ring Final** circuits.\n\n**What they are**\n*   **Radial Circuit**: Think of this like a garden hose. The water (current) flows from the tap (consumer unit) to the nozzle (the last socket or light). If the hose is cut, everything after the cut loses power.\n*   **Ring Final Circuit**: Think of this like a circular running track. The current can travel in two directions around the loop to reach any socket. It starts and ends at the same point in the consumer unit.\n\n**Why it matters**\nRadial circuits are simple and used for lighting or heavy individual appliances (like a cooker). Ring Final circuits are unique to the UK and allow for more sockets on a single circuit because the load is shared across two paths, allowing the use of smaller cables than a radial circuit of the same total capacity would require.\n\n**Key Rules**\n*   Radial circuits can be used for almost any load but are standard for lighting.\n*   Ring Final circuits must always return to the same fuse or breaker they started from.\n*   A ring circuit provides two paths for current, effectively doubling the current-carrying capability of the cable loop.\n\n**Common Mistakes**\nLearners often think a Ring Final circuit is \"faster.\" It isn't; it simply shares the load. A dangerous error is a \"broken ring,\" where the loop is snapped, turning it into two radials that might now be overloaded because they are sharing a single high-rated breaker."

You must match the physical strength and water resistance of the system to the \"External Influences\" of the room.\n\n**Micro-scenario**:\nIf you are wiring a light in a clean, dry bedroom, standard **PVC/PVC** clipped under the floorboards is fine. If you are wiring a light in a car wash, you would use **PVC Conduit** with waterproof seals to keep the moisture out.\n\n**Rules for Selection**\n1.  **Mechanical Risk**: Use Steel Conduit or SWA.\n2.  **Moisture**: Use plastic conduit with solvent-welded joints or specialized outdoor cables.\n3.  **Aesthetics**: Use hidden PVC/PVC or decorative trunking."
