        "content": "### In this lesson\nYou will learn how heat affects wires and how to calculate the right size wire for the job. \n\n*   How installation conditions (like heat and bundling) affect how much current a wire can hold.\n*   What **Correction Factors** are and how to use them.\n*   How to calculate the minimum safe capacity for a conductor.\n\n**What this is**\nEvery wire has a limit to how much electricity it can carry before it gets too hot. This is called **Current-carrying Capacity** ($I_z$). Think of it like a water pipe: if you push too much water through a narrow pipe, the pressure gets too high. In a wire, too much current creates dangerous heat.\n\nHowever, this limit isn't fixed. It changes based on the environment. If a wire is in a hot room, it can't cool down easily, so its capacity goes down. To calculate this, we use a **Correction Factor**. This is a number (like 0.8 or 0.5) that acts as a 'penalty.' \n\n**Why it matters**\nIf you pick a wire based on its standard rating but install it in a hot ceiling, it might overheat and cause a fire. You must apply the 'heat penalties' (Correction Factors) to find out the *real* capacity of the wire in that specific location.\n\n**Key facts / rules**\n*   **Heat** is the enemy. Anything that traps heat (insulation, other cables, hot air) lowers the wire's capacity.\n*   **Ambient Temperature**: If the air is hotter than 30°C, the wire handles less current.\n*   **Grouping**: Bundling cables together is like people huddling in a crowd—it traps heat. You must reduce the rating for every cable in the bundle.\n*   **Thermal Insulation**: Covering a cable with insulation is like wearing a winter coat; the wire can't release heat, so its capacity drops significantly.\n\n**How to calculate it**\nTo find the minimum capacity your cable needs ($I_z$), follow these steps:\n1.  Identify the rating of the **Circuit Protective Device** ($I_n$). This is the fuse or breaker size.\n2.  Find the **Correction Factors** ($C$) for the environment (from a table).\n3.  Divide the device rating by the correction factors: $I_z = I_n / C$.\n\n*Example:* You have a 20A fuse ($I_n$). The cable runs through a hot ceiling with a factor ($C_a$) of 0.80.\nCalculation: $20 \\div 0.80 = 25A$.\nThis means you need a cable that can handle at least 25A, not just 20A, because the heat makes the cable less efficient.\n\n*Micro-scenario:* Imagine a cable rated for 20A in open air. If you wrap it in insulation (factor 0.5), it acts like a 10A cable. If you try to push 16A through it, it will overheat. The math protects you from this mistake.\n\n**Common mistakes**\n*   **Ignoring the factors:** Learners often just match the cable to the load ($I_b$) without checking the fuse size ($I_n$) or the environment.\n*   **Wrong direction:** Remember, correction factors *divide* the current rating in this formula to tell you the *larger* cable you need. \n\n**Key Points**\n*   Calculated capacity ($I_z$) must be $\\ge$ Protective Device Rating ($I_n$).\n*   Correction factors are usually decimals (e.g., 0.8, 0.9).\n*   Dividing by a decimal gives you a larger number, ensuring you pick a bigger, safer cable."

        "content": "### In this lesson\nYou will learn about the devices that protect circuits and how to pick the right one.\n\n*   Types of protective devices (Fuses vs. Breakers).\n*   Matching the device to the load.\n*   Understanding 'Prospective Fault Current'.\n\n**What this is**\nA **Circuit Protective Device** is the 'gatekeeper' of the circuit. It sits at the start of the wire. Its job is to detect **Overcurrent** (too much electricity) and cut the power off automatically.\n\n**Types of Devices**\n1.  **Circuit Breakers (MCBs):** These are the switches found in modern consumer units. If they trip, you can reset them by flipping the switch back up. They come in Types B, C, and D based on how sensitive they are to surges.\n2.  **Fuses:** These contain a thin wire that melts if the current gets too high. Once blown, they must be replaced. They are often used in industrial settings or plugs.\n\n**Key Concepts**\n*   **Design Current ($I_b$):** The current the load actually uses (e.g., a 10A heater).\n*   **Device Rating ($I_n$):** The limit stamped on the fuse/breaker (e.g., 16A). The device will allow up to 16A to flow forever, but will trip if it goes higher.\n*   **Prospective Fault Current:** This is a worst-case scenario. It is the massive surge of energy that *could* flow if there is a direct short circuit—like the pressure behind a dam bursting. The device must be strong enough to break this surge without exploding.\n\n**Rules for Selection**\nTo be safe, the ratings must follow this order:\n$$I_b \\le I_n \\le I_z$$\n\n1.  **$I_b \\le I_n$**: The protective device must be big enough to handle the normal load (so the heater doesn't trip the breaker).\n2.  **$I_n \\le I_z$**: The cable ($I_z$) must be stronger than the protective device ($I_n$). If the cable is weaker than the fuse, the cable will melt before the fuse blows.\n\n*Micro-scenario:* You have a 13A heater ($I_b$). You choose a 16A breaker ($I_n$). You must use a cable that can handle at least 16A ($I_z$). If you used a thin 10A cable, the breaker would happily let 16A flow, burning up the wire.\n\n**Common mistakes**\n*   **Wrong Type:** Using a Type B breaker (sensitive) for a large motor. Motors have a high 'inrush' current (a temporary surge) when starting. This surge trips Type B breakers instantly. You would need a Type C or D, which ignores short surges.\n*   **Oversizing the Fuse:** Putting a 32A fuse on a circuit meant for lights. If a fault occurs, the wires might burn before the 32A fuse notices.\n\n**Key Points**\n*   Fuses melt (one-time use); Breakers trip (resettable).\n*   The device protects the *cable*, not just the appliance.\n*   Always check that the device can handle the potential fault energy (Prospective Fault Current)."

This math tells us to pick a thicker cable that is strong enough to handle the current safely, even with the 'heat penalty' applied.",
