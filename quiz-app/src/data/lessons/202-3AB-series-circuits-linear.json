        "content": "Imagine a garden hose lying on the ground. Water enters at one end, travels through the entire length of the hose, and exits at the other end. There are no branches, no splits, no alternative routes — just one continuous path.\n\nThis is exactly what happens in a **series circuit**. Current (the flow of electrical charge) enters the circuit, passes through each component one after another, and returns to the source. The key characteristic is this **single, unbranched path**.\n\nWhy does this matter? Because this simple topology — one path, no alternatives — creates three predictable and unchanging behaviors that electricians rely on every single day. Understanding these three rules allows you to calculate, predict, and troubleshoot any series circuit you encounter.\n\n**The Real-World Importance**\n\nOld-fashioned Christmas lights were wired in series. If one bulb failed and broke the path, all the lights went out — frustrating, but it perfectly demonstrates the single-path principle. Modern electrical installations rarely use pure series circuits for this reason, but understanding series behavior is essential because:\n\n• Many circuits have series **sections** even if the whole system isn't series\n• Troubleshooting requires understanding how current flows through each component\n• Voltage drops across cables and connections follow series rules\n• Safety calculations depend on knowing total circuit resistance"

        "title": "The Three Series Circuit Rules",
        "content": "**RULE 1: Current Is Identical Everywhere**\n\nIn a series circuit, the current has no choice but to flow through every single component. Think back to the garden hose analogy — if water flows into the hose at 5 liters per minute, then 5 liters per minute must be flowing through the middle section, and 5 liters per minute must be exiting at the far end. The water cannot accumulate inside the hose, and it cannot vanish.\n\nElectrical current works exactly the same way. If 2 amperes enters the first component, then 2 amperes flows through the second component, and 2 amperes through the third component, and so on. The current is **constant** throughout the entire path.\n\nMathematically: **I_total = I₁ = I₂ = I₃ = ... (all the same value)**\n\nThis is arguably the most important series rule because it immediately tells you something crucial: wherever you measure current in a series circuit, you get the same reading.\n\n**RULE 2: Voltages Add Up to the Supply Total**\n\nNow think about energy. Every component in a circuit uses electrical energy to do something — a resistor converts it to heat, a motor converts it to motion, a lamp converts it to light. This energy comes from the voltage supplied by the battery or power source.\n\nImagine you have £20 to spend at three different shops. After visiting all three shops, your £20 is completely spent. Maybe you spent £8 at the first shop, £7 at the second, and £5 at the third. Notice that £8 + £7 + £5 = £20 — the individual amounts add up to your starting budget.\n\nVoltage works identically. If you have a 12V battery and three components in series, each component \"consumes\" a portion of that 12V. The voltage drop across the first component, plus the voltage drop across the second component, plus the voltage drop across the third component must equal exactly 12V.\n\nMathematically: **V_supply = V₁ + V₂ + V₃ + ...**\n\nThis is called **voltage distribution**. The supply voltage is distributed (shared out) among all the components in the path. Components with higher resistance consume more voltage; components with lower resistance consume less voltage.\n\n**RULE 3: Resistances Add Up to Give Total Resistance**\n\nResistance is opposition to current flow. When you place components in series, you are creating **obstacles in sequence** — the current must overcome the first resistance, then the second resistance, then the third resistance, and so on.\n\nThink of running an obstacle course. If the first obstacle takes 30 seconds to cross, the second takes 45 seconds, and the third takes 25 seconds, your total time is 30 + 45 + 25 = 100 seconds. The obstacles are cumulative — you face them one after another.\n\nResistance in series is cumulative in exactly the same way. Each resistor adds to the total opposition that the current faces. A 6Ω resistor followed by a 4Ω resistor creates exactly the same total opposition as a single 10Ω resistor would.\n\nMathematically: **R_total = R₁ + R₂ + R₃ + ...**\n\nThis is brilliantly simple — just add them up. No complicated formulas, no fractions, no division. Series resistance is pure addition.\n\n**Why These Three Rules Always Work Together**\n\nThese three rules are not separate facts — they are interconnected through Ohm's Law (V = I × R). Because current is the same everywhere (Rule 1), and resistances add up (Rule 3), the voltage drops must add up (Rule 2) to satisfy Ohm's Law at every point in the circuit. The mathematics and the physics lock together perfectly."
