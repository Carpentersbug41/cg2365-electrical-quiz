        "content": "**What is a Magnet?**\n\nA permanent magnet is a material (usually iron, nickel, cobalt, or special alloys) that produces its own magnetic field without needing electricity or an external power source.\n\n**Key Properties:**\n\n1. **Every magnet has TWO poles**: North (N) and South (S)\n2. **Like poles repel**: N-N or S-S push apart\n3. **Unlike poles attract**: N-S pull together\n4. **You cannot isolate a pole**: If you break a magnet in half, each piece has its own N and S pole\n\n**Magnetic Fields:**\n\nThe area around a magnet where magnetic forces act is called the **magnetic field**. We represent this using **field lines**:\n\n- Field lines run from **north to south** (outside the magnet)\n- They never cross each other\n- Closer lines = stronger field\n- The field is strongest at the **poles**\n\n**Testing for Magnetism:**\n\nTo test if something is magnetic:\n- Use a compass (the needle is a small magnet)\n- Bring it near iron filings (they align with field lines)\n- See if it attracts magnetic materials (iron, nickel, cobalt)\n\n**Common Permanent Magnets:**\n- Bar magnets\n- Horseshoe magnets  \n- Ring/disc magnets\n- Refrigerator magnets (flexible magnetic material)"

        "title": "Electromagnetism: The Link Between Electricity and Magnetism",
        "content": "**The Discovery:**\n\nIn 1820, Hans Christian Ørsted discovered that electric current creates a magnetic field. This fundamental relationship between electricity and magnetism is called **electromagnetism**.\n\n**How It Works:**\n\nWhen electric current flows through a wire:\n1. A **circular magnetic field** forms around the wire\n2. The field direction depends on current direction (right-hand rule)\n3. The field strength increases with more current\n\n**Electromagnets (Solenoids):**\n\nTo make a stronger, more useful electromagnet:\n1. Coil the wire into a **solenoid** (cylindrical coil)\n2. Add an **iron core** inside the coil\n3. Pass current through the coil\n\n**Result:** The solenoid behaves like a bar magnet with N and S poles at each end!\n\n**Key Advantages of Electromagnets:**\n\n✅ **Switchable**: Turn on/off with current\n✅ **Controllable strength**: More current = stronger field\n✅ **Reversible poles**: Reverse current direction reverses poles\n✅ **Very strong**: Can be much stronger than permanent magnets\n\n**Factors Affecting Electromagnet Strength:**\n\n1. **Current**: More amps → stronger field\n2. **Number of turns**: More coils → stronger field\n3. **Core material**: Iron core → much stronger field\n4. **Coil tightness**: Closer turns → stronger field\n\n**Why Use an Iron Core?**\n\nIron is **ferromagnetic** — it concentrates magnetic field lines, multiplying the field strength by hundreds of times compared to an air core.\n\n**Difference from Permanent Magnets:**\n\n| Permanent Magnet | Electromagnet |\n|-----------------|---------------|\n| Always magnetic | Magnetic only when current flows |\n| Fixed strength | Adjustable strength |\n| Fixed poles | Reversible poles |\n| No power needed | Needs continuous current |"

        "title": "Applications: Motors, Relays, and Transformers",
        "content": "Electromagnetism is the basis for three essential electrical devices:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Electric Motors\n\n**Purpose**: Convert electrical energy into mechanical motion (rotation)\n\n**Basic Principle:**\n- A current-carrying coil is placed in a magnetic field\n- The magnetic field exerts a force on the coil\n- This force causes the coil to **rotate**\n- A **commutator** (split ring) reverses current direction every half turn to keep rotation continuous\n\n**Where Used:**\n- Power tools (drills, sanders)\n- Fans and pumps\n- Washing machines\n- Electric vehicles\n\n**Key Point**: Motors use the interaction between an electromagnet (rotor) and permanent magnets or electromagnets (stator) to produce continuous rotation.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Relays\n\n**Purpose**: Use a small current to control a much larger current safely\n\n**Basic Principle:**\n- A small current energizes an electromagnet\n- The electromagnet attracts an iron armature\n- The armature closes (or opens) contacts in a **separate high-power circuit**\n- When current stops, a spring returns the armature to rest position\n\n**Why Important:**\n- **Safety**: Control high voltage/current from a safe low-voltage switch\n- **Isolation**: Keep control circuit separate from power circuit\n- **Remote switching**: Control distant or inaccessible circuits\n\n**Where Used:**\n- Car starter systems (small ignition key switch controls high-current starter motor)\n- Industrial control systems\n- Safety interlocks\n- Automation systems\n\n**Example**: Your doorbell uses a relay — pressing the button (low current) activates a relay that rings the bell (higher current).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Transformers\n\n**Purpose**: Change AC voltage up or down\n\n**Basic Principle (Introductory):**\n- Two coils of wire (primary and secondary) wrapped around an **iron core**\n- AC current in primary coil creates a **changing magnetic field**\n- The changing field **induces** a voltage in the secondary coil\n- The voltage ratio depends on the **turns ratio** between coils\n\n**Types:**\n- **Step-up transformer**: Increases voltage (more turns on secondary)\n- **Step-down transformer**: Decreases voltage (fewer turns on secondary)\n\n**Where Used:**\n- Power distribution (transmission at high voltage, then stepped down for homes)\n- Phone chargers and laptop power supplies\n- Doorbells (mains voltage stepped down to safe low voltage)\n- Welding equipment\n\n**Important**: Transformers **only work with AC** (alternating current), not DC, because they need a changing magnetic field.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Device | Input | Output | Uses Electromagnet? |\n|--------|-------|--------|---------------------|\n| **Motor** | Electrical energy | Mechanical rotation | Yes (rotating coil) |\n| **Relay** | Small current | Switched high current | Yes (to move armature) |\n| **Transformer** | AC voltage (one level) | AC voltage (different level) | Yes (creates changing field) |\n\nAll three devices rely on the fundamental principle of **electromagnetism**: the interaction between electricity and magnetism."
