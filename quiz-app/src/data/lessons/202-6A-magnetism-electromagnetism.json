We represent this using **field lines**:\n\n- Field lines run from **north to south** (outside the magnet)\n- They never cross each other\n- Closer lines = stronger field\n- The field is strongest at the **poles**\n\n**Testing for Magnetism:**\n\nTo test if something is magnetic:\n- Use a compass (the needle is a small magnet)\n- Bring it near iron filings (they align with field lines)\n- See if it attracts magnetic materials (iron, nickel, cobalt)\n\n**Common Permanent Magnets:**\n- Bar magnets\n- Horseshoe magnets  \n- Ring/disc magnets\n- Refrigerator magnets (flexible magnetic material)"

        "content": "**The Discovery:**\n\nIn 1820, Hans Christian Ørsted discovered that electric current creates a magnetic field. This fundamental relationship between electricity and magnetism is called **electromagnetism**.\n\n**How It Works:**\n\nWhen electric current flows through a wire:\n1. A **circular magnetic field** forms around the wire\n2. The field direction depends on current direction (right-hand rule)\n3. The field strength increases with more current\n\n**Electromagnets (Solenoids):**\n\nTo make a stronger, more useful electromagnet:\n1. Coil the wire into a **solenoid** (cylindrical coil)\n2. Add an **iron core** inside the coil\n3. Pass current through the coil\n\n**Result:** The solenoid behaves like a bar magnet with N and S poles at each end!\n\n**Key Advantages of Electromagnets:**\n\n✅ **Switchable**: Turn on/off with current\n✅ **Controllable strength**: More current = stronger field\n✅ **Reversible poles**: Reverse current direction reverses poles\n✅ **Very strong**: Can be much stronger than permanent magnets\n\n**Factors Affecting Electromagnet Strength:**\n\n1. **Current**: More amps → stronger field\n2. **Number of turns**: More coils → stronger field\n3. **Core material**: Iron core → much stronger field\n4. **Coil tightness**: Closer turns → stronger field\n\n**Why Use an Iron Core?**\n\nIron is **ferromagnetic** — it concentrates magnetic field lines, multiplying the field strength by hundreds of times compared to an air core.\n\n**Difference from Permanent Magnets:**\n\n| Permanent Magnet | Electromagnet |\n|-----------------|---------------|\n| Always magnetic | Magnetic only when current flows |\n| Fixed strength | Adjustable strength |\n| Fixed poles | Reversible poles |\n| No power needed | Needs continuous current |"

        "content": "Electromagnetism is the basis for three essential electrical devices:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Electric Motors\n\n**Purpose**: Convert electrical energy into mechanical motion (rotation)\n\n**Basic Principle:**\n- A current-carrying coil is placed in a magnetic field\n- The magnetic field exerts a force on the coil\n- This force causes the coil to **rotate**\n- A **commutator** (split ring) reverses current direction every half turn to keep rotation continuous\n\n**Where Used:**\n- Power tools (drills, sanders)\n- Fans and pumps\n- Washing machines\n- Electric vehicles\n\n**Key Point**: Motors use the interaction between an electromagnet (rotor) and permanent magnets or electromagnets (stator) to produce continuous rotation.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Relays\n\n**Purpose**: Use a small current to control a much larger current safely\n\n**Basic Principle:**\n- A small current energizes an electromagnet\n- The electromagnet attracts an iron armature\n- The armature closes (or opens) contacts in a **separate high-power circuit**\n- When current stops, a spring returns the armature to rest position\n\n**Why Important:**\n- **Safety**: Control high voltage/current from a safe low-voltage switch\n- **Isolation**: Keep control circuit separate from power circuit\n- **Remote switching**: Control distant or inaccessible circuits\n\n**Where Used:**\n- Car starter systems (small ignition key switch controls high-current starter motor)\n- Industrial control systems\n- Safety interlocks\n- Automation systems\n\n**Example**: Your doorbell uses a relay — pressing the button (low current) activates a relay that rings the bell (higher current).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Transformers\n\n**Purpose**: Change AC voltage up or down\n\n**Basic Principle (Introductory):**\n- Two coils of wire (primary and secondary) wrapped around an **iron core**\n- AC current in primary coil creates a **changing magnetic field**\n- The changing field **induces** a voltage in the secondary coil\n- The voltage ratio depends on the **turns ratio** between coils\n\n**Types:**\n- **Step-up transformer**: Increases voltage (more turns on secondary)\n- **Step-down transformer**: Decreases voltage (fewer turns on secondary)\n\n**Where Used:**\n- Power distribution (transmission at high voltage, then stepped down for homes)\n- Phone chargers and laptop power supplies\n- Doorbells (mains voltage stepped down to safe low voltage)\n- Welding equipment\n\n**Important**: Transformers **only work with AC** (alternating current), not DC, because they need a changing magnetic field.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Device | Input | Output | Uses Electromagnet? |\n|--------|-------|--------|---------------------|\n| **Motor** | Electrical energy | Mechanical rotation | Yes (rotating coil) |\n| **Relay** | Small current | Switched high current | Yes (to move armature) |\n| **Transformer** | AC voltage (one level) | AC voltage (different level) | Yes (creates changing field) |\n\nAll three devices rely on the fundamental principle of **electromagnetism**: the interaction between electricity and magnetism."

Explain: Why is the ability to switch electromagnets on and off so important for these practical applications? How does this controllability make electromagnetic devices more useful than permanent magnets in electrical systems? (3-4 sentences)",
            "answerType": "short-text",
            "cognitiveLevel": "synthesis",
            "expectedAnswer": "The ability to switch electromagnets on and off by controlling electric current makes them essential for practical applications. Motors need the magnetic field to reverse continuously to maintain rotation. Relays need to switch on when activated and release when turned off. Transformers need constantly changing magnetic fields to transfer energy between coils. This controllability means electromagnets can respond dynamically to electrical signals, while permanent magnets have fixed, unchangeable fields that cannot perform these functions.",
