Non-statutory guidance fills that gap by giving the **technical rules and accepted methods**.\n\n**Key exam sentence:**\n- **EAWR 1989 = the law (must prevent danger).**\n- **BS 7671 = the recognised technical rules that show how you achieved safety.**\n\nFollowing recognised guidance helps you show **due diligence** — evidence that you took reasonable steps to work safely."

In real workplaces that means:\n- clear technical justification,\n- documented reasoning (often including risk assessment / design justification),\n- and agreement through the correct process (e.g., design responsibility, supervision, client constraints managed safely).\n\n**Key point:** “It was cheaper” is not a safety justification."
