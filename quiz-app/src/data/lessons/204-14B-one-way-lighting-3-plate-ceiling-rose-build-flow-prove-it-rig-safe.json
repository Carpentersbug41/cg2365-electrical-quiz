        "content": "Safety note (training rig only): This lesson is for supervised training-rig work in an approved dead state. Do not energise equipment. Do not work on real installations.\n\nA one-way lighting circuit (3-plate ceiling rose) is only as good as (1) build quality and (2) the reliability of your test routine. Beginners improve fastest when they follow the same sequence every single time.\n\n## Step 0 — Rig-safe start\nConfirm the rig is in its approved dead state. Identify the correct circuit before touching any conductors.\n\n## Step 1 — Plan from the diagram (wire-journey check)\nBefore you cut/strip anything, you must be able to point to the diagram and say:\n- Which terminal group is the **Loop (permanent live)**.\n- Which conductor is the **switch feed** (Rose Loop → switch COM).\n- Which conductor is the **switch return / switched live** (switch L1 → Rose Switched Live).\n- Where the **Neutral group** joins supply neutral + lamp neutral.\n- Where the **CPC** is terminated at every point.\n\n## Step 2 — Mount accessories\nFix the rose/batten holder and the switch accessory neatly. Covers must fit without crushing conductors.\n\n## Step 3 — Route and prepare cables\n- Bring the **sheath into every accessory** (no single-insulated cores exposed outside).\n- Identify at the ends (don’t leave it ambiguous):\n  - CPC: green/yellow sleeving where required.\n  - Any core used as **live** in the switch drop: **brown identification** at terminations (especially the return if a blue core is used).\n\n## Step 4 — Terminate (follow the 3-plate map)\n- **Loop group:** CU Line + switch feed to COM.\n- **Neutral group:** CU Neutral + lamp neutral.\n- **Switched Live group:** switch return from L1 + lamp live.\n- **CPC:** continuous and terminated at each point (including the switch point).\n\n## Step 5 — Dead inspection (decision gate)\nYou only proceed if inspection is a PASS.\nStop-and-fix examples (don’t ignore): exposed copper, damaged insulation, CPC missing/unterminated, insulation clamped in terminal (“plastic-in”), loose terminations.\n\n## Step 6 — Dead tests + recording (rig-safe)\nYour goal here is NOT to energise anything. It’s to confirm the circuit is safe and ready for results recording and the next supervised stage.\n\n### Dead Test Routine (must be used)\nFor each test:\n1) **Prove** the tester/function/leads (known condition)\n2) **Test** the circuit\n3) **Re-prove** the tester/function/leads\n4) **Record** the value + judgement (Pass / Suspicious / Stop-and-check)\n\nTypical dead tests for this exercise (training rig context):\n- **CPC continuity (low-ohms)** to confirm the protective path is present and continuous.\n- **Insulation Resistance (IR)** between conductors to confirm no unwanted leakage paths.\n- **Polarity logic (dead method)** to confirm the switch is in the line conductor and the correct terminals/groups are used.\n\nCommon beginner mistake to avoid: recording a weird reading without first checking the tester setup. If the result surprises you, your first move is usually: check range, ports, leads, nulling (if used), and repeat Prove → Test → Re-prove."

Prove → Test → Re-prove checks that the tester and leads are working before and after you test, so you can trust the reading. If a result looks strange, you’re less likely to blame the circuit when the real problem is the meter setup. This helps you record results that are safe and reliable.",
