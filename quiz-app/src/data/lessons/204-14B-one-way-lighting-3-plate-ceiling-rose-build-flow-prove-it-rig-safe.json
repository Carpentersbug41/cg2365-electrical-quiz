This lesson is about doing it the same way every time.\n\n## Step 0 — Rig-safe start\nConfirm the training rig is in its approved dead state and your work area is clear. Identify the correct circuit before touching any conductors.\n\n## Step 1 — Plan from the diagram (wire journey check)\nBefore you cut/strip anything, you must be able to explain:\n- Which terminal group is the **Loop (permanent live)**.\n- Which core is the **switch feed** (Loop → switch COM).\n- Which core is the **switch return** (switch L1 → Rose switched live).\n- Where the **Neutral group** joins supply neutral + lamp neutral.\n- Where the **CPC** is terminated at every point.\n\n## Step 2 — Mount accessories\nFix the CU/isolator (rig), switch box, and ceiling rose/batten holder. Covers must fit without crushing conductors.\n\n## Step 3 — Route and prepare cables\n- Bring the **sheath into every accessory** (no single-insulated cores exposed outside).\n- Sleeve/identify immediately:\n  - **Green/Yellow** on CPC at terminations.\n  - **Brown** on any core used as a live (especially the switch return if it is blue).\n\n## Step 4 — Terminate (follow the 3-plate map)\n- **Loop group:** CU Line + switch feed to COM.\n- **Neutral group:** CU Neutral + lamp neutral.\n- **Switched Live group:** switch return from L1 + lamp live.\n- **CPC:** continuous and terminated at each point (including the switch box).\n\n## Step 5 — Dead inspection (decision gate)\nYou only proceed if inspection is a **Pass**. Stop-and-fix examples: exposed copper, damaged insulation, CPC missing/unterminated, loose terminations.\n\n## Step 6 — Dead tests + recording (rig-safe)\nYou now prove the build using a repeatable routine and record results.\n\n### Dead Test Routine (must be used)\nFor each test:\n1) **Prove** the tester/function/leads (known condition)\n2) **Test** the circuit\n3) **Re-prove** the tester/function/leads\n4) **Record** the value + judgement (Pass / Suspicious / Stop-and-check)\n\nTypical dead tests for this exercise (training rig context):\n- **CPC continuity** (low-ohms) to confirm the protective path is present and continuous.\n- **Insulation Resistance (IR)** between conductors to confirm no leakage paths.\n- **Polarity logic (dead method)** to confirm the switch is in the line conductor and the correct terminals are used.\n\nImportant: the student does not energise the rig. Testing is to confirm the circuit is safe and ready for results recording and the next supervised stage."
