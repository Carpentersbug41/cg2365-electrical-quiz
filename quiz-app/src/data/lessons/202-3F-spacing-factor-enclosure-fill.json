        "title": "Understanding Space Factor Principles",
        "content": "**Space factor** (also known as enclosure fill) is a measure of how much room cables take up inside a conduit or trunking. In simple terms, it is the ratio of the total cable area to the available internal area of the enclosure, expressed as a percentage.\n\nWhy does this matter? There are three primary reasons. First is **mechanical protection**. If an enclosure is too full, pulling cables through becomes difficult. High friction can lead to snagging at bends, which may tear or scrape the insulation. This damage might not be visible but can cause faults once the system is live.\n\nSecond is **thermal management**. Every cable generates heat when carrying current. For cables to stay cool, they need air circulation. When cables are packed too tightly, heat cannot escape, leading to insulation breakdown and a significantly increased risk of fire.\n\nThird is **workmanship and future-proofing**. A professional installer leaves 'headroom' (extra space). This makes the initial installation easier and allows for future additions or maintenance without having to rip out the entire containment system.\n\n**Key rules / facts:**\n- Space factor = (Total Cable Area ÷ Enclosure Internal Area) × 100.\n- Overfilling causes mechanical stress and insulation damage during installation.\n- Packed cables overheat because air cannot circulate to remove thermal energy.\n- Calculations must always use the **internal** dimensions of the conduit or trunking.\n- A common rule of thumb for general installations is a 45% limit, though specific regulations vary.\n\nCommon mistakes include using the outside diameter of a conduit instead of the internal diameter, which results in an inaccurate calculation of available space."

We treat cables and conduits as circles, and trunking as rectangles.\n\n**Step 1: Enclosure Area**\nFor **Conduit**, use the area of a circle: A = πr². Remember that radius (r) is half of the internal diameter (ID). For **Trunking**, use the area of a rectangle: A = Width × Height.\n\n**Step 2: Cable Area**\nCables are circular. Calculate the area of one cable using A = πr² (where r is half the overall diameter). If there are multiple identical cables, multiply this area by the number of cables.\n\n**Step 3: Percentage Fill**\nDivide the total cable area by the enclosure area, then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\n**Key rules / facts:**\n- Area of circle = π × r² (π ≈ 3.14).\n- Radius = Diameter ÷ 2.\n- Area of rectangle = Width × Height.\n- Total Cable Area = (Area of Cable 1 × Quantity) + (Area of Cable 2 × Quantity).\n- Percentage Fill = (Total Cable Area ÷ Enclosure Area) × 100.\n\nCommon mistakes include adding diameters together instead of areas. You cannot simply add the widths of cables; you must find the total cross-sectional area because the gaps between cables also take up space."
