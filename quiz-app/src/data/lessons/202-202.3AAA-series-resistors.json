        "title": "The Fundamentals of Series Circuits",
        "content": "A **series circuit** is the simplest way to connect electrical components. In this arrangement, components are connected end-to-end, like links in a chain. This creates **one single path** for the electrons to flow from the negative terminal to the positive terminal of the power supply.\n\n### The Three Golden Rules\nTo master series circuits, you must memorize these three rules:\n1. **Current (I) is the same everywhere.** Because there is only one path, the same number of electrons must pass through every point in the circuit per second. If you measure 2A at the start, you will measure 2A at the end and through every resistor.\n2. **Total Resistance (Rt) is the sum of all resistors.** Adding more resistors to a series chain is like adding more hurdles to a race; it makes it harder for current to flow. The formula is: **Rt = R1 + R2 + R3...**\n3. **Voltage (V) is shared.** The total supply voltage is split between the components. Each resistor takes a portion of the energy, known as a **voltage drop**. The sum of these drops must equal the supply voltage: **Vt = V1 + V2 + V3...**\n\n### Ohm&apos;s Law in Series\nWe use Ohm&apos;s Law (V = I × R) to find missing values. Usually, the first step in any calculation is to find the **Total Resistance (Rt)**. Once you have Rt and the Supply Voltage (Vs), you can find the **Total Current (It)** using: **I = V / Rt**.\n\n### The Voltage Divider Concept\nIn a series circuit, the resistor with the **highest resistance** will always have the **largest voltage drop**. This is because more energy is required to push the current through a higher resistance. If you have a 100Ω resistor and a 10Ω resistor in series, the 100Ω resistor will &quot;grab&quot; much more of the supply voltage.\n\n### Fault Behavior\nUnderstanding faults is critical for an electrician:\n- **Open Circuit:** If a wire breaks or a bulb blows, the path is broken. Current immediately drops to **0 Amps** everywhere in the circuit.\n- **Short Circuit:** If a resistor is bypassed (shorted), the total resistance of the circuit **decreases**. According to Ohm&apos;s Law, if resistance goes down while voltage stays the same, the **current will increase**, which can lead to overheating or blown fuses."
