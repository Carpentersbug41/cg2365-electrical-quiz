        "content": "A **dead inspection** is the first verification step on a training rig. Before you trust any meter result, you use your eyes and hands to confirm the circuit is physically sound, correctly identified, and safe to proceed with **dead tests**.\n\n### Why inspection comes first\nMeters can’t reliably protect you from basic build/termination mistakes such as:\n- a CPC that’s present but **not terminated**\n- insulation clamped instead of copper (**plastic-in**)\n- a loose termination that causes unstable readings later\n- missing identification/sleeving when a core is being used in a different role\n\nInspection prevents two problems:\n1) **Safety risk later** when the rig is energised.\n2) **Invalid test results** (you test a circuit that was built/terminated incorrectly).\n\n### A repeatable inspection order (use the same order every time)\n1) **Start at the supply point / terminals** (identify what circuit you are inspecting).\n2) **Move to switch point(s)** (ID/sleeving, terminations, CPC present and terminated).\n3) **Move to the light point** (correct connections, CPC present and terminated even if fittings are plastic).\n4) **Re-check terminations and cable condition** (no damage, no copper showing, accessories secure).\n\n### Key checklist areas (what each check is proving)\n1) **CPC presence and termination readiness**\n- CPC is present at every point.\n- CPC is **terminated into a proper terminal/block**, not tucked loose.\n- CPC is sleeved/identified at terminations.\n\n2) **Conductor identification / marking**\n- Conductors are identifiable by role at the termination.\n- Where a core colour does not match its role (e.g., switched live in a blue core), correct sleeving/ID is applied.\n- Do not assume colour = function; verify termination role.\n\n3) **Terminations and mechanical integrity**\n- Copper is clamped securely (not insulation).\n- No exposed copper outside the terminal.\n- Correct terminal used and conductors are seated properly.\n- No loose accessories; no strain on terminations.\n\n4) **Damage / overheating risk signs (inspection-only)**\n- Nicked insulation, crushed cable, cracked accessories.\n- Signs of stress at entry points (grommets/edges) where relevant on the rig.\n\n5) **Accessory suitability (rig context)**\n- Correct accessory type for the circuit logic (e.g., 1-way vs 2-way switch type).\n- Correct terminals used on the accessory.\n\n### Decision gate (inspection-only)\n- **Pass:** safe and clear to proceed to meter work.\n- **Suspicious:** needs correction or re-check before proceeding (could distort results).\n- **Stop-and-fix:** do not continue until corrected (safety/validity risk: exposed copper, damaged insulation, missing or un-terminated CPC, incorrect accessory creating unsafe condition)."
