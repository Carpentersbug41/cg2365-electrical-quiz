        "title": "How Transformers Work",
        "content": "A transformer has three essential parts:\n\n**1. Primary Coil**\nThis coil is connected to the AC supply. When AC flows through it, the current constantly changes direction and magnitude. This changing current creates a changing magnetic field around the primary coil.\n\n**2. Soft Iron Core**\nBoth coils are wound around a soft iron core. Iron is used because it:\n- Easily magnetizes (high permeability)\n- Concentrates the magnetic field lines\n- Links the magnetic field from primary to secondary efficiently\n- Loses magnetism quickly when current changes (soft iron)\n\n**3. Secondary Coil**\nThis coil is wound around the same core as the primary, but has **no direct electrical connection** to it. The changing magnetic field in the core cuts through the secondary coil's turns, **inducing** a voltage in the secondary by electromagnetic induction.\n\n**Why AC is Essential:**\nTransformers **only work with AC** (alternating current), not DC (direct current). This is because:\n- AC constantly changes, creating a constantly changing magnetic field\n- A **changing** magnetic field is required for induction\n- DC creates a steady magnetic field that doesn't induce voltage (except at switch-on/off)\n\n**Energy Transfer Without Connection:**\nThe primary and secondary are electrically isolated - no current flows between them. Energy transfers through the magnetic field in the core. This is called **mutual induction**."

Explain: Why are transformers essential for the UK electrical system from power station to homes? How do the concepts you've learned (AC requirement, mutual induction, turns ratio) all contribute to making our electricity supply work? (3-4 sentences)",
            "answerType": "short-text",
            "cognitiveLevel": "synthesis",
            "expectedAnswer": "Transformers are essential because they allow voltage transformation for efficient power distribution. Power stations use step-up transformers to increase voltage to 400kV for transmission (reducing current and power losses). At substations, step-down transformers reduce it to 11kV then 230V for homes. This only works because transformers use mutual induction with AC (DC wouldn't work), and the turns ratio allows precise voltage control at each stage. Without transformers, we couldn't efficiently distribute electricity across the country.",
