        "title": "How Transformers Work",
        "content": "A transformer has three essential parts:\n\n**1. Primary Coil**\nThis coil is connected to the AC supply. When AC flows through it, the current constantly changes direction and magnitude. This changing current creates a changing magnetic field around the primary coil.\n\n**2. Soft Iron Core**\nBoth coils are wound around a soft iron core. Iron is used because it:\n- Easily magnetizes (high permeability)\n- Concentrates the magnetic field lines\n- Links the magnetic field from primary to secondary efficiently\n- Loses magnetism quickly when current changes (soft iron)\n\n**3. Secondary Coil**\nThis coil is wound around the same core as the primary, but has **no direct electrical connection** to it. The changing magnetic field in the core cuts through the secondary coil's turns, **inducing** a voltage in the secondary by electromagnetic induction.\n\n**Why AC is Essential:**\nTransformers **only work with AC** (alternating current), not DC (direct current). This is because:\n- AC constantly changes, creating a constantly changing magnetic field\n- A **changing** magnetic field is required for induction\n- DC creates a steady magnetic field that doesn't induce voltage (except at switch-on/off)\n\n**Energy Transfer Without Connection:**\nThe primary and secondary are electrically isolated - no current flows between them. Energy transfers through the magnetic field in the core. This is called **mutual induction**."

        "content": "**Mutual induction** is the key principle that makes transformers work.\n\n**The Process:**\n\n**Step 1:** AC supply connected to primary → AC current flows in primary coil\n\n**Step 2:** Changing current in primary → Changing magnetic field around primary\n\n**Step 3:** Iron core concentrates and links this field → Magnetic flux flows through core\n\n**Step 4:** Changing magnetic flux cuts through secondary coil turns → Voltage induced in secondary\n\n**Step 5:** If a load is connected to secondary → Current flows in secondary circuit\n\n**Key Point:**\nThe primary and secondary coils are **magnetically linked** but **electrically isolated**. No direct connection exists, yet energy transfers efficiently through the magnetic field.\n\n**Why It's Called 'Mutual':**\nBecause the induction works both ways:\n- Primary creates field that induces voltage in secondary\n- Secondary's magnetic field also affects the primary (though we focus on primary → secondary transfer)\n\nThis mutual coupling through the shared magnetic field is what defines mutual induction."

        "title": "Step-Up and Step-Down Transformers",
        "content": "Transformers can increase (step up) or decrease (step down) AC voltage. The voltage change depends on the **turns ratio** - the number of turns (loops of wire) on each coil.\n\n**The Turns Rule (Level 2):**\n\n**More secondary turns than primary → Step-up (voltage increases)**\n- Example: Primary has 100 turns, secondary has 200 turns\n- Voltage doubles\n- Used for: Power transmission (increase voltage, reduce current losses)\n\n**Fewer secondary turns than primary → Step-down (voltage decreases)**\n- Example: Primary has 200 turns, secondary has 100 turns\n- Voltage halves\n- Used for: Phone chargers, doorbells, LED drivers (reduce mains to safe levels)\n\n**Equal turns → 1:1 transformer (voltage stays same)**\n- Used for: Isolation (safety), blocking DC while passing AC\n\n**Important Level 2 Understanding:**\n\nAt Level 2, you need to know:\n✅ More turns on secondary = step-up = voltage increases\n✅ Fewer turns on secondary = step-down = voltage decreases\n✅ Transformers don't create energy - power in ≈ power out (ignoring losses)\n✅ If voltage increases, current decreases (power conservation)\n✅ If voltage decreases, current increases (power conservation)\n\n**Practical Examples:**\n- **Power station to national grid:** 25kV → 400kV (step-up)\n- **National grid to local substation:** 400kV → 11kV (step-down)\n- **Local substation to homes:** 11kV → 230V (step-down)\n- **Phone charger:** 230V → 5V (step-down)"
