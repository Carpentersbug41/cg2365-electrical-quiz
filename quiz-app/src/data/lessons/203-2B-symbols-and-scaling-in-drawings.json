Sources of Information (AC1)**\nA **Technical Source** is any official document that tells you what to install. \n*   **Specifications:** Detailed written descriptions of materials and quality standards.\n*   **On-site Instructions:** Specific directions given by a supervisor or client.\n*   **Manufacturer Data:** Technical sheets explaining how to install specific equipment.\n\n**2. Drawing Types (AC2)**\nInformation is shown in different ways depending on what you need to see:\n*   **Site Plan:** Shows the building's location in relation to the surrounding area.\n*   **Floor Plan:** A 'birds-eye' view of a room showing where components are located.\n*   **Schematic/Wiring Diagram:** Shows how components are electrically connected, rather than their physical location.\n\n**3. Graphical Symbols & Legends (AC3)**\nBecause drawings are small, we use **Graphical Symbols** (icons) instead of photos. A circle with a line might mean a 'lighting point'. To be sure, you must check the **Legend** (the key). Symbols represent the **function** of an item, not necessarily what it looks like in real life.\n\n**Concrete Anchor:** Think of a car's dashboard. The 'battery' light is a **symbol**. The **Owner's Manual** is the **source** that explains what it means. The **Dashboard Layout** is the **drawing type** showing where all the gauges are.\n\n**Micro-scenario:** You are looking at a 'Floor Plan' (Type) to find a socket. You see a square symbol. You check the 'Legend' (Key) and realize it's actually a data port, not a power socket. You then check the 'Specification' (Source) to see what brand of data port to buy."

If you 'zoom in', the scale changes. On a paper drawing, the scale is fixed in the 'Title Block' (the info box at the bottom). A 1:100 scale means the real object is 100 times bigger than the drawing.\n\n**Common Mistake:** Thinking a 1:100 drawing is 'bigger' than 1:20. Actually, 1:100 is much smaller because the real world has been 'shrunk' 100 times instead of just 20 times."
